Thanks Jimmie I replied Im going to try to stay this way

My wife sat down beside me and studied me closely You look
different she remarked To me at any rate Youre sort of coming to
a focus If only Youre so different andstrange

Here was my chance to recover lost ground

As near as I can make out I said Ive had a kind of amnesia I
know you of course and my name and that this is my house and that
Ponto is my dog even though he tried to bite me I know the Pond Club
and the Harvard Club but thats about all I seem able to remember
I cant recall where I work or where I bank or who my friends are
or what kind of car I drive or what I was doing before yesterday
afternoon

She relaxed at the holy scientific word amnesia as though to name a
mystery explained it

But you were saying something about being on an aircraft carrier in
the Pacific she objected

I laughed That must have been part of a very vivid dream I was having
in a chair in the bar at the Pond when Ranty Tolan woke me up It was
one of those dreams which seemed so real that real life seemed like a
dream It still does a bit Thats where my alleged mind got stalled
and Im still floundering around Help me wont you

You didnt seem to need much help remembering Virginia Rutherford
she remarked but Ill try to fill in some of the gaps for you You
have your own firmTompkins Wasson and Coneat No 1 Wall Street
Its sort of combination brokerage office and investment counsel You
once told me that your specialty was finding nice rich old ladies
and helping them reinvest their unearned millions You bank at the
National City Farmers and your car is a black 41 Packard coupe

That helps a lot I thanked her Now how about my friends If I go
to town tomorrow I ought to be on the lookout for them Business
isnt so good right now that I can afford to let myself be run in as an
amnesiac while my partners look after the loot

She frowned I dont know much about your friends in town since so
many of them are in the war she admitted Theres Merry Vail of
course who roomed with you at Harvard but he hasnt come out here
much since Adela divorced him after that business in Bermuda Sometimes
you talk about the men you see at the Club but Ive never been able
to keep track of the Phils and Bills and Neds and Joes and Dicks and
Harrys Youll have to find your own way there At the office of
course theres Graham Wasson and Phil Cone your partners but you
wont have much trouble once youre at your desk Wasson is dark and
plump and Cone is fair and plump and theyre both about five years
younger than you are

The office doesnt worry me I agreed I can handle anything that
develops there

You know Winnie Jimmie remarked if I were you I wouldnt try to
go to town for a few days The office will run itself and you need a
rest I dont know much about amnesia but Ive always heard that rest
and kind treatment

Uhuh I dissented emphatically Worst thing in the world for it
Ive always heard that the thing to do is to go back over the ground
until you come to the thing that gave you the original shock and then
it all comes back to you If I stick around Bedford Hills Ill just get
panicky over not being sure whether I remember things or not Ill go
to town in the morning and see if I cant find myself

She laughed as wives laugh You may be a changed man she announced
but youre still stubborn as a mule Tell me to change the subject
you say that you remember me Tell me what I seem like to you now
that youve changed as you say aside from age sex scars and
distinguishing marks if any and marital status

I closed my eyes and thought of Dorothy as she had been that last night
in Hartford before she walked out and I decided to join the Navy as a
Reserve Officer

You are piano music on a summer nightsomething Scarlatti or
Mozartthin cool precise gay You are apple blossoms against a
Berkshire hillside You are the smoke of fallen leaves climbing into
the cool October sky You are surf on a sandy beach with the gulls
wheeling and the whitecaps racing past the lighthouse on the point
You are bobsleds and hot coffee and doughnuts by a roaring wood fire
And youre a lost child with two pennies in your fist looking in the
window of a fivecent candyshop

Germaine relaxed Except for that last bit Winnie you made me sound
like a yearround vacation resort or an ad for a new automobile Youve
mentioned almost everything about me except the one thing I obviously
am

Which is

A simple rather stupid woman I guess Germaine sighed whos had
everything in life except what she wants

All women are simple I pontificated since what they want is
simple

You moron she blazed Dont you see that no woman knows what she
wants until she is made to want it You  you never made me want
anything simple except to crack you over the head with something

After she had left I sat for a long time There seemed to be nothing
to do or say Winnies domestic life was still in too much of a snarl
for me to do the obvious thing and follow Germaine upstairs and into
her bedroom lock the door and kiss her tearstained face and tell her
that I was sorry I had hurt her Before it would be safe to accept
her gambits I must first explore my business connections Hadnt my
wife said something about girls in the office

                                   

My first stop in the morning after I had been careful to take a late
commuting train in to the city in order to avoid business men who were
sure to know and greet Winnie Tompkins was the Pond Club

Tammy was behind the bar and as soon as I entered he turned and mixed
me a powerful pickmeup I drained it with the usual convulsive effort
and then pretended to relax

Thanks Tammy I said Thats what I needed Good morning Mr
Tompkins he remarked Im glad to see you back You were looking a
trifle seedyif you dont mind my saying so sirwhen you were in
here Monday afternoon

I took a day off in the country and got rested up I told him I
feel fine now Anybody in the Club

Not just now sir A couple of gentlemen were asking for you yesterday
afternoonthat would be Tuesday That was Commander Tolan sir and
a friend of his a Mr Harcourt his name was who hasnt been here
before They asked me if you were at your home but I just laughed
Him gone home I said Not while he has a girl and a flat on Park
Avenue Begging your pardon Mr Tompkins I knew you didnt want to
be bothered wherever you were and so I said the first thing that came
to my head

Youre doing fine Tammy I assured him I dont want to see anybody
for a couple of days Now then Id like you to tell me what happened
here Monday afternoon Its the first time in my life Ive ever drawn a
complete blank

Well sir the Club steward recited You came in about two oclock
and sat down in your usual chairthat one in the corner You said
something about having had lunch at the Harvard Club sir and had a
couple of Scotch and sodas here

Was I tight Tammy

Not to call tight You didnt show it and after a time you went to
sleep like you was tired out You was still sleeping when Mr Morgan
Mr Davis and Commander Tolan came in That would be a little after
three oclock sir They made some talk about how you were sleeping
through the noise they made that it would take a bomb to wake you
Then sir I guess you had some kind of a dream You began talking like
and thrashing with your arms and making noises So Commander Tolan he
said Jesus we cant drink with that going on and went and shook you
by the shoulder until you woke up Youd been dreaming all right Mr
Tompkins because you talked wild when you woke up about Alaska and
where were you The others joked a bit about it after you left but Id
take my oath sir that you werent really what might be called tight
Mr Tompkins

Thanks a million Tammy I said Thats a load off my mind I drew
a blank and didnt know where Id been or what Id been doing Can you
let me have some money Im a bit short of cash

Of course sir How much will you need

A couple of hundred will do I told him if you have that much

That will be easy sir If youll just sign a check like the house
rules says Ill get it from the safe

He nearly caught me Signing checks was something I simply could not do
until I had learned to imitate Winnie Tompkins signature I had tried
in the guestroom at Bedford Hills the previous evening and found
that my original signature as Frank E Jacklin was completely unchanged
by my transmigration and that my own copydesk scrawl was the only
handwriting I could commit I had burned the notepaper on which I had
made the crucial experiments and flushed the ashes down the toilet One
of my objects in coming to the Pond had been to see if I couldnt get
money by simply initialing a chit

I hastily looked in my billfold There was still a fair amount of
money left It would last me until I found a way to draw on Winnies
bankaccount

Never mind after all I told Tammy I guess I have enough to last
me until I get down to the office If anybody asks for me you havent
seen me since Monday and dont know where I am

Very good sir he agreed Ill take any messages that come for you
sir and not let on Ive set eyes on you

My next stop was at an old hangout of mine and Dorothys from my
early newspaper days a place on East 53rd Street where you can get
a good meal if you have the money to pay for it and the time to wait
for itand I had both I knew that none of Winnies friends would be
seen dead in the place and I didnt want to try lunch at the Harvard
Club where Id have to sign the diningroom order or the barcheck
The place was reasonably uncrowdedit was not quite noonand I had a
pleasant lunch

It was a little after one oclock when I reached the Harvard Club The
doorman glanced at my face and automatically stuck a little ivory
peg in the hole opposite the name of Tompkins on the list of members
I checked my hat and coat and strolled through the sittingrooms into
the large loungelibrary beside the diningroom A couple of men
nodded and smiled as I passed them so I nodded back and said Hi
in a conversational tone In the lounge I found a chair and a copy
of the WorldTelegram so I decided to catch up with the warnews
The German Armies were beginning to crumble but there was still talk
of a stand along the Elbe and Hitler was reported fortifying the
mountaindistricts of Southern Germany into a redoubt for a last
Valhalla Battle The Pacific news was good The fighting on Okinawa was
going our way and the cleanup in the Philippines was well in hand The
Navy Department discounted enemy reports of heavy damage to American
warships by Jap suicidepilots but as an old Navy PRO I could tell
that it had been plenty Id heard about the Kamikazes from some of our
pilots who had seen them off Leyte and I had no doubt that they were
doing a job on the 7th Fleet Roosevelt had gone South for a couple of
weeks rest at Warm Springs Georgia and Ed Stettinius was in the final
throes of organizing the United Nations Conference at San Francisco

Hi Winnie Dont you speak to your old friends any more

I looked up to see a lean wolfishlooking man with a gray moustache
a slightly bald head and definitely Bond Street clothes

Oh hullo I said and returned to reading the paper

The newspaper was firmly taken out of my hands and the man sat down
beside me

Weve got to have a talk he said

Why Whats happened

Theres been a lot of talk about you running around town in the last
twentyfour hours Winnie None of the other alleged friends we know
had the guts to tell you But I thought your roommate

So youre Merry Vail I said stupidly

Youre in worse shape than I thought you were Winnie he replied
Yes Im Merriwether Vail who started his lifelong career of rescuing
Winfred Tompkins from blondes and booze at Harvard in 1916 Now if
youll just crawl out of your alcoholic coma and listen to me for five
minutes before you take off for your next skirt youll learn something
to your advantage

How about a drink Merry I asked to keep in character

Not before five so help me and youd better lay off liquor till you
hear this Here it is Theres a story going the rounds that the FBI
is after you At any rate at least one obvious Gman has been reported
in full cry on your footprints

I sat up startled This was too much even for purgatory What had
Winnie been up to

What am I supposed to have done Merry I asked Trifled with the
Mann Act Told fibs on my income tax return Failed to notify the local
draft board that I was taking the train to New York Bought black
market nylons for my mistress or what

Vail looked mysterious For all I know I may be letting myself in
for Alcatraz old man but the dope is that youve been violating the
Espionage Act communicating with the enemy or stealing official
secrets

I leaned back in my chair and shook with laughter Of all the pure
unadulterated bs Ive ever heard I give you my word of honor as a
Porcellian that theres not a syllable of truth in it

Vail looked increasingly distressed If youre really innocent youd
better be careful Tentoone you havent an alibi and youll need
a lawyer Slip me a bill now and retain me as your counsel No this
isnt a gag Somethings cooking even if its only mistaken identity
and Ive seen enough of the law in wartime to know that youll be
better off with the old cry I demand to see my attorney when they
march you down to the FBI headquarters to answer a few questions

Thanks Merry I said and heres twenty bucks to go on with If
the police are looking for me Id better go down to my office and see
that things are applepie before they lock up the brains of our outfit

Besides I added youve just given me an idea of how I can make a
hell of a lot of money
