Well there it is Harcourt I ended my recitation Miss Briggs
believes me my wife doesnt and I dont expect you to But if youre
interested I can prove Im Frank Jacklin any number of ways

The GMan finished his drink and stared absentmindedly at the ceiling
while Arthurjean poured him a new shot of Bourbon and waterhis fifth

Mr Tompkins he said at last Im drinking your liquor in your
houseor Miss Briggs apartment whichever it isand its not for me
to call you a liar

Dont you dare Arthurjean warned him Not while Im around GMan
or no GMan Say what do the initials A J stand for in your name
Abba Jabba

What do you think Andrew Jackson of course No Mr Tompkins I
wont call you a liar because to tell the truth Im not sure that you
are Lots of funny things have happened in this war This might have
happened But I cant do anything about it

Cant you at least check on the Jacklin angle I asked

Harcourt shook his head Before I could do any checking Id have to
report my reasons to the chief If I was asked for a reason Id have
to explain that I had grounds for thinking that Commander Jacklins
souland the FBI has never established a policy on soulshad been
blown from the Aleutians clear into Westchester County and is now
running round in the body of Winfred S Tompkins stock broker That
report from me would go from my chief right up to J Edgar Hoover the
AttorneyGeneral the Joint Chiefs of Staff the Cabinet and President
Roosevelt Now wouldnt that look nice on my record Wouldnt that
just put me right in line for promotion Be reasonable you two Im
not saying I dont believe this yarn but it would be worth my job to
act like I believed itand I got a wife and three kids in Brooklyn no
fooling

Arthurjean remained silent for a few minutes Andrew Jackson
Harcourt she began

You havent said anything about this sinister guy Roscommon I
interrupted You could do something about him without worrying about
me and my story

Roscommon Harcourt shrugged his shoulders Going after him would
remind me of the time we hit the Governor of North Carolina with a
Great Smoky barbecued bear Roscommon is all he says he is and orders
are out not to touch him How do you think we ought to fight this war
anyhow Blindfold

What about that Great Smoky bear Arthurjean demanded irrelevantly
Youall from the South honeychile

The Old North State sugar And you

Tennessee thank God And the names Arthurjean Andy and for the
millionth time Ill explain that my dads name was Arthur and my
mothers name was Jean so they ran em together like JohnsManville
or PierceArrow but its all one word No hyphen So there

I urged them to get over their rebel yell and come back to the subject
of the bear

Well Mr Tompkins Harcourt explained Its this way Up in the
Smokies we have a special way of cooking bear All you need is a bear
a beetree a twohanded saw and a stick of dynamite First you kill
your bear Thats mighty important You skin him and you gut him and
truss him up like a chicken Then you ram him up as far as you can deep
inside a beetree just below the honey and wedge him in so he wont
slip Then you start a slow fire underneath him inside the tree The
fire sort of slowcooks the bear like a Dutch oven drives off the
bees and melts the honeycomb The honey just naturally drips down on
the bear meat while shes cooking Just about the time the trees ready
to fallcourse I should have explained you saw off the trunk just
above the honey so the bees can get away from the smoke and the old
tree will draw like a chimneyyou set a fuse to a stick of dynamite
toss it in the fire and run like hell Well sir the dynamite goes
off and just naturally shoots the old roast bear out the tree like a
projectile Then you pick it up lug it back to the picnic grounds
and I tell you Mr Tompkins its mighty sweet eating Now this time
we nigh hit the Governor of North Carolina he was making a political
speech over at the old fair grounds and

I think I get the picture Harcourt I said cutting in on him
rapidly We did pretty much the same thing with baby seals and popcorn
in the Aleutians When we were after Jap subs the depthcharges killed
no end of baby sealsconcussion I guess So wed pick em up in a
lifeboat clean them stuff them with unpopped popcorn and stick
them in the fourteeninch guns Then wed touch off a reduced charge
behind em Seals are naturally oily so they went out the muzzle like
a regular shell The intense heat of the explosion not only cooked the
seal but popped the popcorn That puffed out set up air resistance and
reduced trajectory Then wed send a helicopter out to pick em up and
have em in mess Cold with chili sauce they were delicious One time
when we were bombarding Attu the crew of No 3 turret forgot we had a
seal in the center gun and fired it at a Jap redoubt It hit

I can see Arthurjean remarked that Ive been missing a lot of fun
here in New York though Ill never forget the time we pretended we
found a dead mouse in a mince pie at the WaldorfNow who in hell can
that be

The doorbell rang insistently

Harcourt looked a little uneasy I thought it might save a lot of time
and trouble he said if I asked Mrs Tompkins to meet us here I
told her that Miss Briggs was a friend of minesugar youd better
go in the other room and put on red nightthingsso you dont need
something more de trop than those to worry Mr Tompkins

Thats just dandy Harcourt I agreed Did you ever see a wife who
couldnt spot a sexsituation at a hundred yards upwind on a dark and
rainy night

Cant say I did the Special Agent admitted but Ive never had but
one wife and shes busy with the kids

There was a knock on the door and Harcourt opened it with a courtly
manner

Come right in Mrs Tompkins he said My friend Miss Briggs is in
the other room and will be out in a moment Mr Tompkins and I

This said Germaine is Mrs Rutherford After Winnie didnt turn
up for a couple of nights we put our heads together and decided that
two could worry as cheaply as one So when I got your message I just
phoned Virginia and here we are Hullo Winnie is this another of your
homes away from home

Virginia Rutherford looked pretty much the way a roasting bear in a
beetree might be expected to feel while waiting for the dynamite to
explode very sweet redhot and not giving a damn whether she hit the
Governor of the Old North State

Hullo Winnie she remarked dangerously This another of your
tousled blondes

I resent that Arthurjean said from the doorway This is my
flat and I didnt invite you and Ill have you know that Im a very
respectablewell rather respectableworking girl

The effect of virtue was only slightly marred by the fact that as she
spoke a pair of silk panties slowly but inexorably slid below the hem
of her skirt and settled in a shimmer at her feet Arthurjean looked
down

Oh hell girls she said Whats the use Have a drink

Thank you Miss Briggs Germaine replied I will Make mine straight
Scotch and the same for Mrs Rutherford Are you by any chance
employed in my husbands office

Im his secretary Arthurjean admitted

Winnie Jimmie turned on me with a snap like those doors in Penn
Station which open by an electric eye and you swore that you had
nothing to do with the officegirls I was fool enough to believe you

At the time dear I explained guiltily I didnt know it myself

Harcourt came lumbering to my rescue Before you leap to any
conclusions Mrs Tompkins he urged I think I ought to explain that
I represent the FBI and that Mr Tompkins came here today at my
request Your husband happens to be in very serious trouble under the
Espionage Act I personally am convinced that theres been a mistake
and that hes innocent but my opinion is of no value unless I can
find evidence to support it

Whats he done Virginia Rutherford asked eagerly Will he go to
jail

Unfortunately Mrs Rutherford Harcourt replied Im not allowed
to discuss the nature of the charges against him No formal indictment
has been lodged and if you can help me none will be made The
important thing is to know where he was and what he was doing from the
twentyfifth of March until the second of April

Why the twentyfifth of March my wife demanded He was with me at
Bedford Hills most of that time I and the maid at the house Myrtle
can testify to that I dont think he went to the office much that
week It was Holy Week He and I went to church

Mrs Tompkins he said you are a true and noble lady Its just too
bad that one of our agents has already interviewed the Hubble girl who
testified that Mr Tompkins didnt come home once all that week

Germaine sank back in her chair and looked at me with an air of
misplaced consecration Winnie she urged go ahead and tell him
where you were Im your wife and I dont care what silliness you were
up to or what woman you were with just so they dont send you to
prison

I smiled at her Jimmie I replied I give you my word I simply
dont remember I dont know where I was As I told you the other day
Ive drawn a blank as to what happened before last Monday afternoon

Mrs Rutherford took advantage of the moment of incredulous silence
which followed this announcement

Dont try to be chivalrous Winnie she urged me We hadnt planned
to advertise it Jimmie but Winnie spent that week with me He rented
a flat for me uptown Mr Harcourt about six weeks ago and we put in
a whole week together I daresay you think Im a loose woman but

Harcourt looked quite painfully embarrassed I surely do not want to
contradict a lady he told her but the Bureau checked up on that
apartment yesterday The janitor and the cleaning woman both stated
that except for last Monday afternoon and evening when you were there
by yourself neither you nor Mr Tompkins had been near the place for
at least two weeks The bed linen and the bath towels hadnt been used
and the food in the icebox was stale There had been no garbage

Oh flared Virginia of all the lowdown snoopers

The countrys at war Mrs Rutherford the Special Agent replied
And while Im at it I might as well save Miss Briggs the trouble of
telling me that Mr Tompkins spent that week here with her He did not
Weve checked this apartment house most thoroughly as well as Mr
Tompkins office

Why that particular week I asked

Harcourt turned to me apologetically In view of your earlier
statements to me he declared Im sure you will understand this
explanation A certain ship did not sail from a certain port until the
26th of March A certain article was not delivered on board that ship
until after she had sailed Before then the individual who brought
the article to the ship had no knowledge which ship had been selected
Before then nobody on that ship had any knowledge that any article
would be brought on board and had no knowledge of the nature of its
voyage Whatever arrangements were made must have been made during the
following few days That at any rate is the working theory the Bureau
has adopted Have you no idea of where you might have been in that
period Mr Tompkins

I placed my head in my hands and thought back to that misty morning
ten days before when the Alaska pulled out of Bremerton Navy Yard and
headed north through Puget Sound for Victoria and the Strait of Juan
de Fuca I remembered how as we returned recognition signals to the
Canadian base at Esquimault a destroyer had put out come alongside
and put a civilian passenger aboard us I remembered the fuss he raised
on the bridge while we made a lee for the destroyer and hoisted a large
packingcase on board and how it was hurried below decks with a Marine
guard Then I thought of the run out west past Dutch Harbor and Adak
our light carrier slipping through the drifting fogs of the Aleutians
while the slow Pacific swell pounded against our port beam and the
turbines whined and ship shook and the icy wind whipped across the
flightdeck And I remembered that last night in the mess when Windy
Smithof Texas naturallyboasted that he

No Mr Harcourt I told him Im afraid that the things I remember
wouldnt help either of us You go ahead and see what you can find out
about me and so will I

Winnie Germaine said reproachfully Tell him where you were dear
Its no use pretending that you dont remember I know that you can
explain I know theres nothing really wrong

Arthurjean walked across and put her hand on Jimmies arm Youd
better have another drink Mrs Tompkins she remarked and so had I
This sort of thing is tough to take

Virginia looked up brightly at Harcourt If Winnie wont help himself
I will she said Ill find out what the big dope was doing and when
I dolook out

Come on Jimmie I told my wife Lets go home Ive had about as
much of this as I can stand Harcourt you know where you can reach me
if you get the word from Washington In the meantime why dont you
follow up that Roscommon angle Thats the best lead Ive struck

Harcourt finished his Bourbon Mr Tompkins he observed youre
quite right but there isnt a single thing I can do about it Weve had
toplevel orders to lay off that guy and with the Bureau orders is
orders
