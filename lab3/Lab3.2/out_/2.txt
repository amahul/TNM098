Winnie The voice that crackled at me over the wire had all the
implacable tenderness of a woman who has you in the wrong

Yes dear I answered automatically with a passing thought for my
own lost Dorothy marooned in Washington with a job in the OSS

What is the matter the voice continued in its litany of angry
possessiveness What on earth happened to you Ive been waiting for
you since three oclock 

Where have you been waiting

Hereof course In our place In New York Winnie whats wrong

Not a pleasant spot to be in even if it was only part of a trialrun
in purgatory

Its a bit too hard to explain Virginia I said but something came
up and I dont think I can go through with it In fact I know I cant
go through with it

There was one of those pauses which make a whole lifetime seem like a
splitsecond

Something came up The voice now a pantherish contralto purred
dangerously Something went down you mean You see Winnie Ive been
talking to your friends Johnny Walker Black Label thats what went
down At the Pond Club I tried out the scales and found that my
involuntary host weighed over 195 poundsa good deal of it around the
middle Tommy Morgan told me all about it You went to the Pond had too
much to drink woke up about four oclockone whole hour after you had
promised to meet meand woke up talking wildly and then staggered out
Now I find youre back in Bedford Hills and itits my birthday
The voice ended in a choke which might have been a sob or a paroxysm of
feminine fury

I summoned the old voice of authority as inculcated at Quonset
into the welltanned vocal chords of Winfred Tompkins Virginia I
commanded just stop making a fool of yourself Im sorry I stood you
up but things have been happening I just cant go through with it
Ill explain when I see you

Youd better And the slam of the receiver left my ears ringing

When I turned around my wife was smiling with a glint in her eye
which was far from sympathetic

Poor Winnie she observed Youd better stick to your office
stenographers and not go picking up redheaded married women in
Westchester You havent got a chance

I refilled my glass and hers in that ordera husbandly gesture which
put me I felt on a solid married basis for the moment

Jimmie I announced I dont need to tell you that Im an awful
heel Now that weve got the wraps off I wish youd tell me what you
really think of me and Virginia

Mrs Tompkins nostrils flickered slightly I never cared for bulging
redheads myself she said When she was at Miss Spences we called
her Virgin for short but not for long There never was a thing in
pants up to and including scarecrows that she wouldnt carry the
torch for When she married Jerry Rutherford it was a great relief to
her relatives She had no friends

A very succinct summary for all that it should be written in letters
of fire I remarked And now what do you think of me

She took a long sip of her drink and leaned forward Youre fat soft
and spoiled Winnie physically mentally and morally she began and
you know it If you werent so stinking rich youdwell I dont know
Theres something about you thatsWell after you bought me from my
parents I wanted to kill myself and then I sized you up Theres no
real harm in you Winnie its not hard to like you but you never were
loves young dream

What you say is absolutely on the beam I admitted But while
were on the subject I wouldnt call Jerry Rutherford the answer to a
maidens prayer That Hollywood doctor type with the swank suburban
practice and the soft bedroom manner gets me down He has only three
ideas in the world and all of them begin with I After the first
antiseptic raptures youd have nothing in common but your appendix and
hed want to get away with thatfor a consideration

Jimmie giggled You forget that he already has it she said Thats
how I was first attracted to him under the ether cone I was sick as a
dog and he held my hand and told me I was being very brave

And sent the hell of a bill to me I added

Well she asked after a pause What do you really think of me

I think Jimmie that youre lonely bored and unhappy All three are
my fault but they are driving you to make a fool of yourself Nobody
has tried to understand youwhich is catnip for any person of either
sex once you get them talking about themselvesleast of all your
husband You need what other women needchildren a home

If this is a buildup for obstetrics the answer is No she snapped
angrily

Skip it I urged Im telling you the truth not making a pass at
you We can talk some more about you in the morning In the meantime I
think Ill turn in Im very tired a little tight and Ive had a lousy
day

She flashed me a curious look Go on up Winnie she said Ill put
these things away Youll need your strength for the morning if I know
Virginia Rutherford

Guided by luck and the smell of pipe tobacco I found what was
obviously the Masters Roomwith a weird amalgam of etchings of ducks
and nude girls including one Zorn and all the gadgets for making
sleep as complicated as driving an automobile

I was awakened in the morning by a hand on my shoulder It was
MaryMyrtle

Youd better get up and put on your pyjamas and dressing gown she
remarked conversationally Dr Rutherford is downstairs and Mrs
Rutherford is talking with Mrs Tompkins in her bedroom

Stormy weather

Ill say soand see here she began

Sit down Mary I ordered

She subsided on the edge of the bed and looked at me rebelliously

From now on Mary I announced things are going to be different
around here I wont refer to what is past because youre old enough
to know what youre doing and so am I If you want to stay on and
really help me through a hard time Ill double your wages If youd
rather goand I wouldnt blame youIll pay you six months wages in
advance and you can clear out But I cant be worried about you and
your feelings when I have a big problem to clean up here Will you go
or stay

The girl thought for a moment then rose straightened her apron and
gave me the first friendly smile I had received since my arrival from
the Aleutians

Ill stay Mr Tompkins she said And heres a pickmeup I mixed
for you Better drink it before you see the Rutherfords

Okay And I drank it and it worked its beneficent will upon me Now
Ill go and kill Dr Rutherford if youll toss me my flitgun and
thanks

Dr Rutherford was pacing with surgical precision up and down my den
He looked slightly more selfpossessed than the day before and seemed
to be in excellent physical condition I guessed at the contour beneath
my wadded black silk dressing gown and reconsidered my original
plan to throw him bodily out of the house for having come without my
invitation

See here Tompkins he said briskly Were both men of the world I
hope Things cant go on like this I was up all night with Virginia
Youre not behaving at all well you know old man

I sat down in the corner of the leather lounge and looked up at hima
move which gave me a slight advantage of position in dealing with the
higher emotions

Lets not mince words Jerry I said Suppose you just state frankly
what you think we should do

Germaine loves me and does not love you Rutherford stated crisply
You love Virginia and she loves you None of us wish a divorce Hang
it all Winnie were civilized These things happen you know and we
might just as well face them We agreed that the four of us should do
as we liked and no hard feelings

I sighed Jerry I said What you say was true as of yesterday noon
but if these things can happen they can also unhappen Whatever you
and my wife decide to do is your own affair but Im damned if I intend
to allow her to use my home as a place of assignation and Im damned
if Ill let her become the subject of gossip So far as Virginia is
concerned whether or not she is in love with me Im no longer in love
with her and Im damned if Ill play gigolo to spare the feelings of a
bulging redhead who carries the torch for anything in trousers up to
and including scarecrowsmyself included

I cant allow you to talk that way about my wife Tompkins Its
rotten bad form and anyhow we both know that people are the way their
glands make them and nothing can be done about it

Here have a drink I suggested This is all under the seal of a
confessional Im not quarreling with you Im consulting you I dont
love Virginia and I dont believe I ever did If you wish to wriggle
out of your marriage thats your affair

And its yours too ever since that night at the War Bond Ball he
said Dont forget that I caught you

Rutherford I replied As a medical man you have surely seen far
worse than that You cant sue me for alienation of affections because
all Bedford Hills is aware of Virginias glands and because it wouldnt
help your practice For the rest Im willing to listen to anything as
a way out of this mess

He paused in his precise pacing The four of us will have to talk it
over he said as soon as I have that drink you offered me

Okay I agreed The girls are in Jimmies bedroom Perhaps you know
the way better than I do Ill follow your lead

Germaine was propped up in a frilly fourposter bed amid a wallow of
small satin cushions I barely had time to notice that she was wearing
a rather filmy night gown when I turned to reap the whirlwind in the
form of five foot six of redhaired determination and curves

Now Winnie she commanded Whats all this nonsense

I caught a telltale glimpse of uncharitable diamonds at my wifes
breast and hastily averted my eyes from the monogram

Virginia I replied Theres nothing wrong Nothing at all It was
just that yesterday I realized that I couldnt go through with it I
dont pretend to be moral but I wont go in for mixeddoubles at my
age Its undignified

What Mrs Rutherfords mouth hung open in amazement

Only this Virginia Whatever I have been in the past Im going to
try to be different in the future I know its hard on you but

The redhead laughed like tumbrils rolling to the guillotine Nothing
to what a breach of promise suit would be to you Winnie dear Dont
forget I have your letters

Now were getting somewhere I remarked How much

Winnie my wife gasped Its blackmail

Of course its blackmail I agreed and there are times when its
wiser to pay than to fight This is not one of them Virginia Im not
interested in buying back those letters Save them for a rainy day Im
going to settle with your husband How about it Jerry

You swine Mrs Rutherford was going definitely GradeB in the
pinches Do you think that you can drive a wedge between me and my
husband

No my wife has already done that for me He loves her and he tells me
that she loves him Ive told him that theyre welcome to a divorce but
I wont have my house used for any hankypanky and wont have people
gossip about Germaine They can make up their minds what they want to
do about it

You were saying downstairs Tompkins the doctor hastily
interrupted that you would listen to any reasonable offer

Check Whats your price

I want out said Dr Rutherford Lend me the value of a years
practicefifteen thousand would cover itand Ill get in a substitute
and take a crack at the Army Medical Corps Theyve been after me for a
couple of years

Done I said and if you like Ill have the bank dole it out to
Virginia while youre gone so she wont use it up too fast

What about me asked my wife I thought Jerry said he loved me

Whats your price I asked

Germaine yawned and the shoulder strap of her gown slipped
indiscreetly Since nobody seems to want me she declared Im going
to stick around and see the fun I wouldnt miss the sight of Winnie
Tompkins trying to lead a changed life for all the doctors in the
Medical Corps

Me too spat out Mrs Rutherford Theres something pretty
mysterious going on here and Im going to stay until I learn all the
answers

There was a tap at the bedroom door and Myrtle appeared pulling two
neatly set breakfast trays on a rubbertired mahogany teawagon

I thought you would rather have your breakfast upstairs with the
Master mam she remarked primly in a far too English countryhouse
manner Breakfast is waiting for Dr and Mrs Rutherford in the
diningroom she added

And as she bent over the table and began to straighten out the
breakfast things the girl had the impudence to slip me a wink
