A pretty darkhaired maid opened the door of Pooks Hill with a
twitch of the hip that was wasted on Bedford Hills

Oh its you She remarked conversationally Shall I tell Mrs
Tompkins you are here

And why not I asked

She looked at me slanteyed Why not sir She must have forgotten to
eat an apple this morning Thats why

Where shall I dump my hat and coat Mary I asked guessing wildly at
her name Suburban maids were named Mary as often as not

The name is Myrtle Mr Tompkins she replied and did not bother to
add the as well you know she implied

From now on Myrtle you shall be Mary so far as I am concerned And
where Mary shall I leave my hat and coat

In the den sir of course Come Ill lend a hand Youve been
drinking again

The girl moved quite close to me in helping me off with my things and
it was only by a distinct effort of will that I refrained from giving
that provocative hip the tweak it so openly invited

This way Mr Tompkins she said sarcastically so I rewarded her
with a halfhearted smack which brought the requisite Ohyou never
can tell when you will need a friend below stairs and it was obvious
that Winnie the dog had been trifling with her young buttocks if not
her affections That sort of thing must stop if I was going to get
anywhere in my run through the maze Too abrupt a change in the manners
and morals of Winfred Tompkins however might arouse suspicion

Any news today Mary I asked

Nothing sir The kennels telephoned to say that Ponto had made a
miraculous recovery and could come home tomorrow I had them send word
to the Club to tell you And Mrs Tompkins as I said forgot to eat
her apple

I looked at her This was a cue I mustnt miss it

And the doctor didnt keep away I asked

Him I should say not Mrs Tompkins felt quite unsettled right after
lunch and phoned Dr Rutherford to come over Hes with her now
upstairs giving her an examination She rolled her eyes significantly
in the direction of the second story

Wait a few minutes till I catch my breath and get my bearings Mary
I said and then tell Mrs Tompkins most discreetly if you know what
I mean that I have returned and am waiting in my I waved vaguely at
the room

In your den sir she agreed The name is Myrtle

The den was one of those things I have never attained perhaps because
I never wanted to There was a fieldstone fireplace over which the
antlered head of a small stag presided with four upturned feetlike a
calf in a butcher shopthat held two well dusted shotguns The walls
were lined with books up to a dadobooks in sets with red morocco and
gilt bindings Dickens Thackeray Surtees Robert Louis Stevenson
Dumas Balzac and similar standard authorsall highly respectable and
mostly unread On the table beside a humidor and cigarette cases was
a formidable array of unused pipes Above the shelves the walls were
adorned with etchings of ducks ducks sitting ducks swimming ducks
nesting ducks flying and ducks hanging dead It was as though Winnies
conscience or attorney had advised him You cant go wrong on ducks
old boy Instead he had gone wild

In one corner of the den my unregenerate Navy eye discerned a
small portable bar with gleaming glasses decanters and syphons
Further investigation was rewarded by the makings of a very fair
Scotchandsoda To my annoyance the cigarette box contained only de
luxe Benson  Hedgesit wouldwhile I am a sucker for Tareytons
Still any cigarette is better than no cigarette A little mooching
around the fireplace revealed the switch which turned on an electric
fire ingeniously contrived to represent an expensive Manhattan
architects idea of smouldering peat The whole effect was very cosy in
the Town and Country sensea gentlemans gunroomand I had settled
down most comfortably on the broad leather divan in front of this
synthetic blaze when I was interrupted by an angry tenor voice

I say Tompkins soared the voice I thought we had agreed to be
civilized about this thing

I raised my head to see a lean darkhaired dapper little man with
a dinky little British Raj mustache and a faint odor of antiseptics
glaring at me from the doorway

Dr Rutherford I presume I remarked

Yes Winnie came a pleasant but irritated womanly voice from
somewhere behind the doctor and I too would like to know what this
means

Is that you Jimmie I guessed

Of course its me Who else did you expect One of those flashy
blondes from your office

Sh shushed the doctor reprovingly What about Virginia What have
you done with her

This required serious thought The glass of Scotch was a good alibi for
amnesia To whom do you refer I asked putting a slight thickness
into my voice

To Virginia my wife he snapped We agreedit was understood
between the four of us

I shook my head virtuously I havent set eyes on her all day I
said I dont know where she is and I refuse to be held responsible
for her in any particular Shes your lookout not mine

Why you The doctor started forward menacing me with his surgical
little fists

Wait a minute Jerry the contralto voice ordered Let me handle
this

Germaine Tompkins stepped forward into the room and stood in the
flickering light of the electric peat Tell me Winnie she asked
has anything gone wrong

My wife was a tall slim girl with dark eyes dark hair parted sleekly
in the 1860 style and a cool slender neck She was wearing something
lowcut in black velvet with a white cameo brooch at the V of a
bodice which suggested a potentially undemure Quakeress I noticed that
she had angry eyes a sulky mouth and a puzzled expression

Im sorry Jimmie I replied after a good look at her but I have
decided that I simply couldnt go through with it

Do you mean to say Dr Rutherford began only to be hushed by
Germaine Let me handle him Jerry she whispered Youd better go
Hes tight Ill phone you in the morning

All right if you say so dear the doctor obeyed

And be sure to send me a bill for this call I added Professional
services and whatnot And dont come back to my house without my
personal invitation

Dr Rutherford emitted a muttered comment and disappeared into the
gloom of the hall My wife followed him and I could hear a series of
confused and comforting whispers sending him on his way I had finished
my Scotch and poured myself another before my wife rejoined me

Have a drink I asked

No thank you she snapped

Mad at me

What do you think Her tone was cool enough to freeze lava

You have every right to be That answer I had found by experience
was unanswerable

What do you mean she asked in some bewilderment Yes thanks I
will have a drink after all You see Winnie after we had talked it
all over the other night after the Bond Rally Dance and realized how we
felt about it all the four of us decided to bewellcivilized about
things And now

I dont feel civilized about my wife I said pouring her a stiff one

Her eyes glittered and her cheek was tinged with color In spite of
her anger she responded to the idea of male brutes contesting for her
favor

I didnt think you cared a damn she said at last and its pretty
late in the day to make a change now After all there is Virginia

That was the cue to clinch the situation To hell with Virginia I
announced Id rather live with you as your friend than sleep with la
Rutherford in ten thousand beds I cant help it I added boyishly

She leaned forward and sniffed You have been drinking havent
you she remarked

Of course I have Today in town I suddenly realized what a damn
fool Id been to throw away something really fine for something very
secondrate So I drank Too much And the more I drank the more I knew
that I was right and that it was here where I belong with you If you
dont want me to stay Ill go over to the Country Club for the night
Ill even phone Jerry Rutherford for youhim and his moustachebut
Im damned if Ill go running back to Virginia Shes not pukka
Howm I doing I added silently for the benefit of the Master of
Ceremonies

Well she said after a long pause PerhapsIts so mixed
upPerhaps youd better go to bed here and we can talk it over in the
morning All of us

I shook my head I dont want to hold any more massmeetings on the
state of our mutual affections If you want that tenor tonsilsnatcher
youre welcome to him but Im damned if Ill be a good sport about
it If you insist Ill buy you a divorce but I wont marry
Virginiathats final

Germaines face relaxed She smiled Well see how things look to you
in the morning she said

Now was the time to play the trump card

Oh yes I said I brought home a present for you

I walked over to the hanger in the corner and pulled the Tiffany
packages from my overcoat pocket

Here you are Jimmie Tompkins I said with all my alleged love

Alleged is right But she picked eagerly at the wrappings and swiftly
ferreted out the diamond brooch Why Winnie its lovely she
began then whirled on me her eyes blazing Is this a joke she
demanded

Of course not Whats the matter

Her laugh was wild Oh nothing Winnie Nothing at all Its just
that you should have decided to give meon her birthdaya brooch
with her initials in diamonds See them VMR

So thats the catch I thought I should have guessed there would be
something wrong with the setup and I kicked myself for not having
bothered to trace out the monogram

Dont you see what I mean I grated or must I spell it out for you
Some time back when we were considering all this civilized swapping
of husbands and wives I put in the order at Tiffanys for Virginias
birthday present Today when I picked it up the clerk smirked at
mehe knows your initials dont begin with Vand I suddenly knew I
couldnt go ahead with the whole business So I brought the brooch back
to you as a trophy if you want it You can do what you like about it
Its yours You see Jimmie I added thats the way things are Im
burning all my bridges

Oh she said Then after a long pause she added Ah

I dont think she remarked after another pause that Ill want to
keep this and Im far too fond of Virginia Rutherford to humiliate her
I think Ill just take this back to Tiffanys and get something else

So I had led trumps

Heres something else to be going on with I told her I got this
for you anyhow win lose or drawand I produced the gold bracelet
I thought it would go with that dress and your cameo andif you still
want to wear ityour wedding ring

She cast quick glances from side to side like a bird that suspects a
snare

Its good she sighed Winnie its so good I guess

There was a knock at the door It was MyrtleMary

Will the master be staying for dinner Mrs Tompkins she asked

Of course I will Mary I said Is there enough to eat

Ill see sir she replied in a manner which was practically an
insult to us both

And keep a civil tongue in your head I added

She handed it back to me And keep your hands to yourself sir she
said as she closed the door

Winnie It was Jimmies hand restraining me as I started up

Let her go I said at last Its my fault I guess I havent been
happy and I did make a few passes From now on Ill try to be a bit
more decent and livable God knows I have plenty to be ashamed of but
nothing disgraceful  I hope

So do I my wife began If you

The telephone rang

She picked up the receiver and listened for a moment frowning

Yes hes here she said passing me the instrument

Its for you she observed Its Virginia calling from New York and
she sounds most annoyed
