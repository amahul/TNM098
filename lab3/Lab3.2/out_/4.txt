Tompkins Wasson  Cone maintained sincerelooking offices on one
of the upper floors of No 1 Wall Street The rooms were carefully
furnished in dark wood and turkeyred upholstery in a style calculated
to reassure elderly ladies of great wealth that the firm was careful
and conservative

The girl at the reception desk looked as though she had graduated with
honor from Wellesley in the class of 1920 and still had itpincenez
and condescensionbut she was thoroughly uptodate in her
officetechnique

Oh Mr Tompkins she murmured in a clear low voice theres a
gentleman waiting to see you in the customers room a Mr Harcourt
Hes been here since ten oclock this morning

Hes had no lunch I inquired

She shook her head

I clucked my tongue We cant have our customers starve to death can
we Send out for a club sandwich and some hot coffee Give me five
minutes to take a look at my mail and then send him in When the food
arrives send that in too I clean forgot

She blinked her hazel eyes behind her pincenez to show that she
understood and I walked confidently down to the end of the corridor to
where a Mr Tompkins stared at me conservatively from a glazed door

My office lived up to my fondest dream of Winnie It was an ingenious
blend of the 1870s and functional furniturelike a cocktail of port
wine and vodka There were electric clocks a silenced stockticker
in a glasscovered mahogany coffin an elaborate Sheraton radio
with shortwave reception tuned in on WQXR and desks and chairs
and divans and a really good steel engraving showing General Grant
receiving Lees surrender at Appomattox Court House with a chart
underneath to explain who was who in the picture

The desk I was glad to note was bare except for an electric
clockcalendar which told me that it was 312 pm of April 4 1945
and a handsome combination humidor cigarette case and automatic
lighter in aluminum and synthetic tortoiseshell A glance out the
window gave me a reassuring glimpse of the spire of Trinity Church
There was a single typed memo on the glass top of the desk which read
Mr Harcourt 1013 am Would not state business Will wait

I pushed one of the array of buttons concealed underneath the edge of
the desk and a door opened to admit a largish blonde in a tightfitting
sweater

Yes Mr Tompkins

Please have Mr Harcourt sent in I said And when he comes bring
your notebook and take a stenographic record of our conversation
anderwhats your name

She raised her wellplucked eyebrows Im Eleanor Roosevelt my
parents named me Arthurjeanafter both of themArthurjeanMiss
Briggs to you

Very well Miss Briggs tell Mr Harcourt Ill see him now

A moment later she reappeared holding a card in her fingers as though
it was a live cockroach Sure you want to see this she asked

The card read Mr A J Harcourt Special Agent Federal Bureau of
Investigation U S Department of Justice U S Court House Foley
Square New York 23 N Y

Of course I replied Ive been expecting him for some time

A J Harcourt was neat but not gaudy a cleancut Hart Shaffner and
Marx tailored man of about thirtyfive with that indefinable family
resemblance to J Edgar Hoover which always worries me about the FBI

Good afternoon Mr Harcourt I said pleasantly and what can I do
for the FBI

Harcourt shook my hand took a seat refused a cigarette and cast a
doubtful glance over his shoulder at Arthurjean Briggs who was working
semisilently away at a stenotype machine

Oh thats my secretary I explained I always have her take a
record of important conversations in this office I hope the machine
doesnt disturb you Mr Harcourt

If its all right with you its all right with me he said
grudgingly I thought perhaps youd rather have this private

Not in the least I replied Miss Briggs is the soul of discretion
and I can imagine nothing we could talk about that I wouldnt want her
to hear

The GMan looked as though he was worrying over whether he ought to
call Washington for permission They hadnt taught him this one in
the FBI academy of fingerprinting marksmanship shadowing and
wiretapping

By the way Mr Harcourt I added I just learned as I came in that
youve been waiting for me since ten this morning Its after three now
so I took the liberty of sending out for a sandwich and some coffee for
you I thought you might like a bite of lunch while you are talking
with me

The Special Agent looked as surprised as though he had found Hoovers
fingerprints on the murdergun but he nodded gamely

Here it is now I remarked as there was a knock on the door and
a knowinglooking boy placed an appealing trayload of sandwiches
pickles and coffee in front of Mr Harcourt

Now you go right ahead and eat your lunch I urged Ask me for any
information in my possession and you shall have it And of course
Ill have Miss Briggs send a complete transcript of our talk to you
at FBI headquarters by registered mail First of all if you dont
mind would you show me your official identification and let Miss
Briggs take down the number and so on Its always best to put these
things in the record isnt it

The GMan gulped and produced a battered identity card complete with
fingerprints number Hoovers signature and a photograph which would
have justified his immediate arrest on suspicion of bankrobbery

I imagine Mr Harcourt I remarked that youve had plenty of time
in the last five hours to question members of my staff about whatever
it is you think they might know about my business

He looked up almost pathetically I asked a few questions he
admitted This is just an informal inquiry Nothing for Grand Jury
actionyet

I didnt like that last word

Do you think I ought to call my lawyer in before I proceed with our
talk I asked I resent your reference to Grand Jury action So far
I dont even know what you wish to see me about and you have just made
a libelous statement in front of a reliable witness Is that the way J
Edgar Hoover trains his Gestapo

Iwell

Come on Harcourt lets get on with it I interrupted Im a busy
man and youve wasted five hours of the time my taxes help to pay for
just waiting to take more of my time

He pulled a black leather notebook out of his pocket and consulted it

The Bureau was asked to interrogate you Mr Tompkins on behalf of
another government agency

Which Internal Revenue WPB The SEC

No sir it was none of those Im not at liberty to tell you which
one I am simply instructed to ask you what you know about USS
Alaska and naval dispositions in the North Pacific

I leaned back and laughed Now I get it I said Thats ONI and
that tripleplated ass Ranty Tolan trying to win the war in the
barrooms of New York It all goes back to a dream I had while I was
dozing at the Pond Club Monday afternoon Something about the USS
Alaska being blown up off the Aleutians Tolan was there when I woke up
and I passed a few remarks about my dream before I was fully awake if
you know what I mean Thats all there is to it Mr Harcourt

The Special Agent made a number of hentracks in his notebook

Thank you very much Mr Tompkins he said No doubt youll be able
to explain things if my chief wants to call you in I dont think my
chief believes in dreams Not that kind of dream Not in wartime

I laughed again Im afraid I cant help that So far as I am
concerned the FBI can believe in my dream or stick it in the files

Harcourt coughed Its not easy working with ONI or other
intelligence outfits he said They never tell us anything The
trouble with your dream seems to be that the general public isnt
supposed to know that the USS Alaska is in commission and that the
Navy department has had no word from her since last Saturday

Dont let that worry you I said If she was anywhere near the
Kuriles shed keep radio silence specially off Paramushiro

Oh Harcourt remarked ONI didnt say anything about Paramushiro
Thank you Mr Tompkins Well be in touch with you off and on

He rose very politely shook hands again thanked me for the food
nodded to Miss Briggs and made a definitely Grade A exit

His steps died away down the corridor Miss Briggs waited until he
was out of earshot then turned to me You God damned fool she said
fondly You had him bluffed until you talked about Paramushiro Why
did you admit anything

I looked up at her broad pleasant face

So youve made a monkey out of me I alibied you up and down Listen
Winnie the FBI have been all over the joint since early yesterday
We were warned not to whisper a word to you There was an agent waiting
to grill me when I got home last night I told him youd been spending
the weekend with me

You told him I was startled

Sure Why not He wasnt interested in my morals I told him about our
place up in the fifties and gave you a complete alibi from Friday close
of business until Monday noon And now you have to make like a Nazi
with the ships in the Pacific Say what is it youve supposed to have
donekissed MacArthur

Damned if I know Miss Briggs Thats part of the trouble

Lay off that Miss Briggs stuff That was to punish you for giving
me the fisheye when you came in Im your Arthurjean and the markets
closed so youd better catch the subway uptown with me and Ill cook
you a steak dinner at our place

This was too deep water for hesitation so I took the plunge Taking
my hat and coat I told the genteel receptionist that Id be back in
the morning I waited for Arthurjean at the foot of the elevators and
followed her lead into the East Side subway and up to the 51st Street
station on to our place

It was very discreetan old brownstone front converted into small
apartments There was no doorman and an automatic elevator prevented
any intrusive check on the comings and goings of the tenants The
thirdfloor front had been made into a pleasant little tworoom
suitea masters bedroom Why not mistresss I thought with a
doublebed dresser and chairs and an array of ducks which revealed
the true Tompkins touch There was a small sittingdining room as
well and a kitchenette with a satisfactory array of bottles in the
Frigidaire and a reasonable amount of groceries

Arthurjean took off her hat and coat fixed me a good stiff drink and
then disappeared into the bathroom After a good deal of splashing and
gurgling she reappeared clad in maroon satin pyjamas

There she said now I feel better

I smiled at her Heres to Arthurjean I said

Nuts to Arthurjean she replied How about Winnie Youve always
been swell to me and you know it I dont care if youre a louse or
a souse You can always come to me any time youre in trouble and
Ill fix you up Now youre in trouble with the cops so how about me
helping you Huh

Youre a good kid I said truthfully for Arthurjean was indeed one
of Gods own sweet tarts The truth is Im in all kinds of a jam You
see I cant seem to remember what Ive been doing before last Monday
Its sort of like loss of memory only worse This FBI thing is only
one of my headaches

She looked at me questioningly So you dont remember where you were
before Monday she asked She slouched across the room leaned down
and gave me a hearty kiss Will that help you remember It was like
I told that detective You and me were right here in this place over
Easter and dont forget it

I sighed I liked Arthurjean though she was as cornedbeef and cabbage
to Germaines caviar and champagne Okay I said I wont forget it

Attaboy she agreed Now that weve got that settled suppose you
tell me where the hell you really were over the weekend You stood me
up Friday night and todays the first time Ive set eyes on you since
you left the office Friday morning Boy you may have some explaining
to do to the FBI but its nothing to what you got to explain to
momma
