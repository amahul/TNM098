When the bomb exploded USS Alaska was steaming westward under
complete radio silence somewhere near the international dateline on
the Great Circle course south of the Aleutian Islands

It was either the second or the third of April 1945 depending on
whether the Alaska the latest light carrier to be added to American
naval forces in the Pacific had passed the 180th meridian

I was in the carrier in fact in the magazine when the blast
occurred and I am the only person who can tell how and why the Alaska
disappeared without a trace in the Arctic waters west of Adak I
had been assigned by Navy Public Relations to observe and report
on Operation Octopusthe plan to blow up the Jap naval base at
Paramushiro in Kuriles with the Navys recently developed thorium bomb

My name by the way is Frank Jacklin LieutenantCommander USNR
I had been commissioned shortly after Pearl Harbor as a result of
my vigorous editorial crusade on the Hartford Conn Courant to
Aid America by Defending the Allies I was a lifelong Republican
and a personal friend of Frank Knox so I had no trouble with Navy
Intelligence in getting a reserve commission in the summer of 1940
I never told them that I had voted for Roosevelt twice so I was
never subjected to the usual doublecheck by which the Navy kept its
officercorps purged of subversive taints and doubtful loyalties So
I had a firstrate assignment by the usual combination of bootlicking
and yessing which marks a good PRO

It was on the first night in Jap waters after we had cleared the
radius of the Naval Air Station at Adak that Professor Chalmis asked
me to accompany him to the magazine He said that his orders were to
make effective disclosure of the mechanics of the thorium bomb as soon
as we were clear of the Aleutians Incidentally he I and Alaskas
commander Captain Horatio McAllister USN were the only people
aboard who knew the real nature of Operation Octopus The others had
been alerted via latrine rumor that we were engaged in a sneakraid
on Hokkaido

The thorium bomb Chalmis told me had been developed by the Navy
parallel to other hitherto unsuccessful experiments conducted by the
Army with uranium The thorium bomb utilized atomic energy on a
rather low and inefficient basis by scientific standards but was yet
sufficiently explosive to destroy a whole city He proposed to show me
the bomb itself so that I could describe its physical appearance and
to brief me on the mechanics of its detonation leaving to the Navy
scientists at Washington a fuller report on the whole subject of atomic
weapons He had passes signed by Captain McAllister to admit us to
the magazine and proposed after supper that we go to examine his
gadget

It was cold as professional charity on the flightdeck with sleet
driving in from the northwest as the icy wind from Siberia hit the
moist air of the Japanese Current There was a nasty crosssea and the
Alaska was wallowing and pounding as she drove towards Paramushiro at a
steady 30 knots

You know Jacklin said Chalmis as the Marine sentry took our passes
and admitted us to the magazine I dont like this kind of thing

You mean this war I asked noticing irrelevantly the way the
electric light gleamed on his bald head

I mean this thorium bomb he replied I had most to do with
developing it and now in a couple of days one of these nice tanned
naval aviators at the mess will take off with it and drop it on
Paramushiro from an altitude of 30000 feet The timer is set to work
at an altitude of 500 feet and then two or three thousand human beings
will cease to exist

The Japs arent human I observed quoting the Navy

Chalmis looked at me in a strange staring way

Thank you Commander he said You have settled my problem I was
in doubt as to whether to complete this operation in the name of
scientific inquiry but now I see I have no choice See this he
continued

This was a spherical finned object of aluminum about the size of a
watermelon resting on a gleaming chromiumsteel cradle

If I take this ring Jacklin Chalmis remarked and pull it out
the bomb will explode within five seconds or at 500 feet altitude
whichever takes longer The five seconds is to give the pilot a margin
of safety in case of accidental release at low altitude However
dropping it from 30000 feet means that the five seconds elapse before
the bomb reaches the level at which it automatically explodes

You make me nervous Professor I objected Cant you explain
without touching it

If it exploded now approximately twentyfour feet below the
waterline Chalmis continued it would create an earthquake wave
which could cause damage at Honolulu and would register on the
seismograph at Fordham University

Ill take your word for it I said

So concluded Chalmis if the bomb were to go off now no one could
know what had happened to the Alaska and the Navyas I know the
Navywould decide that thorium bombs were impractical too dangerous
to use And so the human race might be spared a few more years of life

Stop it I ordered lunging forward and grabbing for his arm

But it was too late Chalmis gave a strong pull on the ring It came
free and a slight buzzing sound was heard above the whine of the
turbines and the thud of the seas against Alaskas bow

You I began Then I started counting Threefourfi

                                   

There was a hand on my shoulder and a voice that kept saying Snap
out of it I opened bleary eyes to see a familiar figure in uniform
bending over me My head ached my mouth tasted dry and metallic and I
felt strangely heavy around the middle

Hully Ranty I said Havent seen you since Kwajalein Whats the
word What happened to the Alaska

Commander Tolan USNR who had been in my group in Quonset
straightened up with a laugh When were you ever at Kwajalein
Winnie he asked And whats the drip about the Alaska

You remember I said That time we went into the Marshalls with the
Sara in fortythree But what happened to my ship There was a bomb
Say where am I and what day is it anyway

There was a burst of laughter from across the room and I turned my
head I seemed to be sitting in a deep leather armchair in a small
nicely furnished bar with sportingprints on the wall and a group of
three cleanshaven only slightly paunchy middleaged men who looked
like brokers standing by the rail staring at me Tolan was the only
man in uniform These couldnt be doctors and what were civilians doing
in mess

We blew up I insisted Chalmis said

Youve been dreaming Winnie drawled one of the brokerish trio You
were making horrible noises in your sleep so Ranty went over and woke
you up

If you want to know where you are remarked another youre in the
bar of the Pond Club on West 54th Street as sure as your name is
Winfred S Tompkins and this is April 2nd 1945

Winnie Tompkins I exclaimed Why I once knew him quite well He and
I were at St Marks together then he went to Harvard and Wall Street
while I went to Yale and broke so we didnt see much of each other
after the depression

Its a good gag Winnie Tolan laughed but now youve had your fun
how about another drink

I shook my head Listen Ranty I begged Tell me what happened
I can take it Are you dead Are we all dead Is this supposed to be
heaven Whats the word

That jokes played out said Tolan Here Tammy another Scotch and
soda for Mr Tompkins A double one

Tompkins My head ached I stood up and walked across the room to study
my reflection in the mirror behind the bar Instead of my painfully
familiar freckled face and skinny frame I saw a red full jowled face
with bags beneath the watery blue eyes set on a distinctly portly body
which was cleverly camouflaged as burliness by impeccable tweeds of the
kind specially made up in London for the American brokers trade

I look like hell I muttered Well tell me this Ranty What
happened to Frank Jacklin Or is that part of the gag

Tolan turned and stared at me with an official glitter in his Navy
Reserve eye Jacklin He was at Kwajalein with me now that I
think of it A skinny sort of sob wasnt he

I wouldnt say that I hotly rejoined I thought he was a pretty
decent sort of guy Where is he

Jacklin Oh he got another halfstripe last January and was given
some screwball assignment which took him out of touch Hell turn up
sooner or later without a scratch those New Dealers always do

Say Tolan added You always did have a Jacklin fixation but you
never had a good word to say for the louse What did he ever do to you
anyhow Ever since Ive known you youve always been griping about
him specially since he got into uniform Lay off will you and give
us honest harddrinking guys a chance to get a breath Period

I took my drink and sipped it attentively Whatever had happened to me
since the thorium bomb burst off Adak this was Scotch and it was cold
so I doubted that this place was Hell Probably it was all a dream in
the last splitsecond of disintegration

Thanks Ranty that feels better Now Ive got to be going

Winnie drawled one of the brokers tell us who she is this time
You ought to stop chasing at your age and bloodpressure or let your
friends in on the secret

This time I said Im going home

The steward came around from the bar and helped me into a fine
furlined overcoat which I assumed was the lawful property of Winnie
Tompkins

There were two telephone messages for you sir while you were
dozing he said

Who were they from Tammy

The first one sir was from the vets to say that Pontothat would
be your dog sirwould recover after all He was the one that had
distemper so bad wasnt it sir I remember you told me that he was
expected to die any minute Well now the vet says he will recover
The second call sir was from Mrs Tompkins She asked if you had left
for your home

What did you tell her Tammy I asked

Why what you told me sir of course when you came in sir I said
that you hadnt been in all day but that I would deliver any messages

Wait a minute Jacklin I said to myself Lets figure this one out We
were blown up on the Alaska off the westernmost Aleutians and now we
find ourselves at the Pond Club in New York City masquerading in the
flabby body of Winnie Tompkins This must be Purgatory since nobody
who has ever been there would call the Pondor as the initiates
prefer the Puddleeither Heaven or Hell This is one of those damned
puzzles designed to test our intelligence My cue is to turn in the
best and most convincing performance as Winnie Tompkins who has
undoubtedly been sent to Hell If we pass well be like the rats the
scientists send racing through mazes well get the cheese and move
on up If we flunk well be sent down as the English say Ingenious
deity the Manager

Tammy I said will you get me the latest Social Register

Certainly sir

I sat down by the door and thumbed through the testament of social
acceptability as measured in Manhattan There I was Winfred S
Sturgis Tompkins Born New York City April 27 1898 St Marks
School Southboro Mass 1916 Harvard A B 1920 Married Miss
Germaine Lewis Schuyler of New York City 1936 Clubs Porcellian
Pond Racquet Harvard Westchester Country Residence Pooks Hill
Bedford Hills NY Office No 1 Wall Street NYC

Thanks Tammy I said and returned the register to him

Then I reached inside my coat and pulled out the wellstuffed
pocketbook I found inside the suave tweeds It was of ostrichhide
with WST in gold letters on it and containedin addition to some
junk which I didnt bother to examinesixtyone dollars in small bills
and a new commutationticket between New York City and Bedford Hills
NY

So far so good My sense of identity was building up rapidly I felt
in my trousers pocket and found a bunch of keys and about a dollar
and a half in silver I peeled a fivedollar bill from the roll in the
pocketbook and handed it to the club steward

This is for you Tammy and a happy Easter Monday to you If anyone
calls you havent seen me all day

Thank you very much sir Im sure he said pocketing the five spot
with the effortless ease of a prestidigitator or headwaiter

I strolled out to the streetdusk was beginning to darken the city
and already there were lights burning in the office windowsand
walked across to the corner of Park Avenue To my surprise remembering
New York there were few taxis and those were already occupied After
about five minutes of vain waiting I remembered reading somewhere
of the cab shortage in the United States and walked south to Grand
Central As I turned down Vanderbilt Avenue I noticed something
fairly bulky in the pocket of my overcoat I stopped and dragged out
two expensively tidy packages with the Tiffany label on them One was
inscribed For Jimmie and the other For Virginia

This represented a new puzzleperhaps a trapso I paid a dime for
the use of one of the paytoilets in the Terminal and unwrapped my
find The one marked for Jimmiewho might be I guessed my wife
Germainewas a neat little solid gold bracelet the sort of thing you
give your eldest niece on graduation day The one marked Virginia
contained a diamondbrooch of the kind all too rarely given to a girl
for any good reason

Uhuh I shook my head Whoever Virginia might be she was
obviously not my wife and the Social Register had not mentioned any
children exwives or such appertaining to Winnie Tompkins And you
dont give diamonds to your aged aunt or your motherinlaw We cant
have Winnie start off his new life by palming off mere gold on his
wedded wife and diamonds on the Other Woman I decided So I switched
the labels on the packages and returned to circulation in time to
catch the 445 Westchester Express

                                   

Here I resorted to a low subterfuge Instead of the brokers bible
The New York Sun with its dim view of all that had happened to the
commuting public since 1932 I was coward enough to disguise myself by
buying a copy of PM in order to lessen the risk of being recognized
by fellowpassengers whom I certainly would not know by sight I buried
my face in that spirited journal with its dim view of all that had
ever happened outside the Soviet Union as I slunk past the Club Car
and did not fully emerge from its gallant defense of the Negro and the
Jew until I was in the smoker directly behind the baggage compartment
The train was fairly crowded but I was able to find a seat far forward
where few passengers could see my face I decided that my strategy had
been sound when the conductor on punching my ticket remarked See
youre not using the Club Car today Mr Tompkins Shall I tell Mr
Snyder not to wait for you for gin rummy

Dont tell him a thing please I begged Im feeling done ina
friend of mine was just killed in the Pacificand I dont want to be
bothered

He clucked consolingly and passed on I was lucky enough to reach
Bedford Hills without other encounters and walked along the darkened
platform until I spied a taxicab

Can you drive me out to my place I asked the driver

Sure Mr Tompkins Glad to he replied Goin to leave your coop
down here

I nodded Yep Im too damned tired to drive home Got any other
passengers

Only a couple of maids from the Milgrim place he said but we can
drop you first and let them off afterwards if youre feelin low

Hell no I insisted This is a free countryfirst come first
served You can drive me on to Pooks Hill after youve left them at
the Milgrims Perhaps theyd get in trouble if they were delayed

The driver looked surprised and rather relieved

Havent heard of any employers firin maids in these parts since
Wilkie was a candidate he said

I climbed into the cab across the rather shapely legs and domestic
laps of two attractivelooking girls who murmured vaguely at me and
then resumed a discussion of the awful cost of hairdos I felt
rather pleased with myself I seemed to have won at least one mans
approval in the opening stages of my celestial ratrace Now for my
first meeting with the woman whom I had married nearly ten years ago
according to the Social Register Surely she would recognize that there
was something radically wrong with her husband before I had been five
minutes at Pooks Hill Why I wouldnt know where the lavatory was
let alone her bedroom and what should I call the maid who answered the
door assuming we had a maid
