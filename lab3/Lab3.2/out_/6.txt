After a pleasant breakfast in the course of which my wife read the
social news in the New York HeraldTribune and I the business news
in the New York Times I excused myself and returned to my bedroom
Winnies bathroom was fitted with all the gadgets too and there was
an abundant choice of razors from the oldfashioned straightedge
suicides favorite to the 1941 streamlined electric Yankee clipper
I tried out the scales and found that my involuntary host weighed
over 195 poundsa good deal of it around the middle Oh well a few
weeks of setting up exercises would take care of that A cold shower
and a brisk rub made me feel a little more presentable and I climbed
shamelessly into Winnies most manly tweeds

Are you catching the ten oclock dear Germaine called from her
bedroom

No such luck I warned her Phone the office will you and tell
them Im feeling under the weather and wont be in till sometime
tomorrow

This seemed like a good chance to do some exploringsince the
Rutherfords had temporarily abandoned the fieldthough I neednt have
bothered since I had seen photographs of suburban houses like Pooks
Hill in a score of different slickpaper prewar magazines There was
the inevitable colonialtype diningroom with dark wainscoting below
smooth oysterwhite plaster electric candlesconces and the necessary
array of family silver on the antiqued mahogany sideboard The windows
gave a vista of brown lawn with the grass still blasted by winter
There was the inevitable chintzy livingroom with a permanently
unemployed grandpiano two or three safely secondrate paintings by
safely firstrate defunct foreigners There was the usual array of
sofas easy chairs small middlesized and biggish tables with lots
of china ashtrays and a sizable woodburning fireplace Of course
you entered the livingroom by two steps down from the front hall and
there was a separate uptwostepsentrance to my den And sure as death
and taxes there was a veritable downstairs lavatory

I slipped on my coat and hat and stepped out through a French window
which led from the livingroom to the inevitable paved stone terrace
There were galvanized iron fittings for a summer awning and in the
center was a cute little bronze sundial This had an exclamation point
and the inscription Over the YardArm at the place where noon should
be and a bronze cocktail glass instead of the sign for four pm All
the way around the rest of the circle was written in heavy embossed
capitals The Hell With It

My meditations on this facet of the Tompkins characterand I wondered
whether I oughtnt to spell facet with a uwere interrupted by
Myrtle

Oh Mr Tompkins she called from the kitchen window in complete
repudiation of her earlier appearance as Watson third ladys maid at
Barony Castle the man from the kennels is here with Ponto Where
shall I tell him to take the dog

I hurried back indoorsthere was still a chill in the air and I really
prefer my trees with their clothes onand found a gnarled little man
who reeked of saddlesoap and servility

Well sir Mr Tompkins he beamed the Old Retainer at me That
dog of yours had a close call a mighty close call Thought he was a
sureenough goner Tried everything injections oxygen iron lung
enema No dice Then yesterday afternoon he just lay down and went to
sleep and I thought My Wont Mr Tompkins feel bad But he woke
up large as life and twice as natural and began carrying on so that
I guess he wanted to come home to his folks Hes a mite weak Mr
Tompkins very weak I might say but hell get well quicker here than
at my place and Ill pop in every other day to keep track of him Never
did see anything like the recovery that dog made in all my born days
Now about his bowels

I waited until he had to draw a breath and made swift to congratulate
him on his professional skill I wouldnt have lost Ponto for a
thousand dollars I said Lets get him out of your car and up in my
bedroom I added Hes been like a member of the family and

A series of deep bass backs interrupted me followed by ominous
sounds of a heavy body hurling itself recklessly around inside a small
enclosed space

There said the vet He recognized your voice Come on Ponto Ill
fetch you Hes pretty weak Mr Tompkins but hell get strong fast if
you feed him right

The vet twinkled out the front door and returned shortly leading a
perfectly enormous coalblack Great Dane on a plaited leather leash
Ponto did not look very weak to me but Ive always been fond of dogs
and I figured that kindness to animals might count in my favor Good
dog I condescended Poor old fellow

The poor old fellow gave a low but hungry growl and lunged for me with
bared teeth dragging the vet behind him like a dory behind a fishing
schooner I jumped into the den and slammed the door while Ponto
sniffed snapped and grumbled on the far side of my defenses

Tell you what doctor I called through the panels Take him
upstairs and put him in my room Its the one to the right at the head
of the stairs Hes just excited Shut him in and as soon as hes
calmed down Ill make him comfortable

While this rather cowardly solution was being put into effect I sat
down and thought it over Apparently Winnie had been the kind of man
whose pet dog tried to rip his throat out That was puzzling since
from what I remembered of him at school he had if anything been
only too amiable I waited out the vets lastminute report and
instructions and then rang the bell for the maid

Mary I said will you help the doctor with his hat and coat and
then take Ponto a bowl of water The poor old fellows had a rough
time

The vet departed and I listened while the maid went upstairs Then
there was a scream the crash of breaking china and the sound of a door
being slammed I bounded up the steps to find Mary whitefaced and
trembling looking stupidly at the broken remains of a white china bowl
and a sizeable puddle of water on the hardwood floor outside my bedroom

The door of my wifes room burst open and Jimmie appeared with a wild
What on earth

Its that dog sir gasped Myrtle When I comecamein with the
bowl of water like you said there he was lying ononyour bed like
a Human andand

And what I demanded

And he was wearing your pyjamas sir she sobbed Itsits

Uncanny Germaine supplied the word

I gave a hollow laugh He probably remembers that he isnt allowed to
lie on the beds Mary and may have dragged my pyjamas up there to lie
on Whenever I let him up on the furniture I always make him lie on
some of my clothes

Oh Myrtle said suddenly calm Is that it It was just that it
looked sort of queer to see his legs in the pyjama trousers

Well dont worry about it now Myrtle my wife remarked firmly
Im not surprised it gave you a shock Hes such a big dog Ill go in
and see that hes comfortable Come on Winnie Lets take a look at
him Whats the matter she added noticing a certain reluctance in my
attitude

Nothing much I martyrized Its only that he flew for my throat
when he got inside the door

Nonsense she replied in the firm tone of a woman who knows better
and who in any case expects her husband not to be afraid of a mere
infuriated Great Dane You know Ponto always puts his paws on your
shoulders and licks your face every morning as you taught him

My rollicking laughter was a work of art Of course that was it I
agreed and hed been away from us so long that he was overeager
Come on lets see if we cant make the poor beast comfortable

But I let her lead the way

The poor beast was lying panting on my still unmade bed The flowered
Chinese silk pyjamas which I had worn at breakfast were indeed
strangely twisted around its gaunt body The coat was across the
animals shoulders and both of its hindlegs were sticking through one
of the trouserlegs

There Ponto Poor old fellow cooed Jimmie in a voice which would
have charmed snails from their shells

Ponto gave a selfpitying whine and his tail thumped the pillow like
an overseers whip across the back of Uncle Tom My wife patted
the animals head and Ponto positively drooled at her She gently
disentangled him from among the pyjamas and hung them up in the closet
As she turned toward the bed he jumped to the floor reared up put
both paws on her shoulders and licked her face convulsively giving
little whines and shiverings

Poor old fellow poor old Ponto she crooned Was he glad to get
home from the nasty old kennel There And she massaged his ears
Come on now Ponto she remarked more authoritatively say good
morning to your master

The answer was a grand diapason of a growl and the baring of a thicket
of gleaming white fangs in my direction

Ponto she ordered as the beast positively cringed Say good
morning to the master

He slumped to the floor with the grace of a poleaxed calf and
approached me slowly ears back hair bristling and teeth in evidence

Ponto Germaines cry was positively totalitarian but the dog lunged
at me and I barely had time to close the door in its face

A few minutes later Germaine emerged looking bewildered Ive never
known him to behave like this she said I dont like it Its always
been you he was so fond of and he barely tolerated me Now he seems all
mixedup After you left he calmed right down and came back and licked
my face all over again What do you suppose is wrong with him Can it
be fits

I shook my head He doesnt act like fits I said Hes had a bad
go of distemper and is probably suffering from shock Dogs do get
shock you know I remember in Psychology at Harvard they told us about
a very intelligent St Bernard dog which was shocked into complete
hysteria by the supernatural That is they pulled a lamb chop across
the floor by a thread concealed in a crack between the boards The dog
nearly had heart failure when he saw a chop moving by itself

But what can we do she asked Lets send him back to the kennels
until hes cured

Nope From what Dr Whatsisname

Dalrymple

From what Dalrymple said hed started acting up at the kennels and
hethe vet that isthought Ponto would be better off at home

But we cant have him going for you every time you use your room

Then I wont use it Ill sleep in the guestroom I added swiftly
lest she leap to feminine conclusions You might take him another bowl
of waterhes all right with youand spread the New York Times on
the floorand a damned good use for itand bring out my clothes and
things He seems to have quite a leech for you and well just leave him
there to think things over by himself

How about his food she asked Shouldnt he have a special diet

No Ill let him go hungry for a day or so So long as he has plenty
of water it wont hurt him Then when hes weak enough so as not to
be dangerous Ill bring him some nice dogbiscuits and warm milk and
hell learn to love me the best way by the alimentary canal

She looked at me closely You do look rocky she said Youve had
a shock too Hadnt I better call the doctor

I shook my head No more doctors please Im out of condition I
guess and all this dodging Great Danes is hard on the nerves Ill go
down and mix myself a brandyandsoda You might join me when youve
moved my things upstairs Weve got to talk over a lot of things

When I finally managed to settle down in my den with a stiff drink I
felt besieged bewildered and backed up against the wall There could
be no reasonable doubt about itthe dog knew Ponto knew that I was
an interloper that the real Winnie Tompkins no longer existed that a
stranger was masquerading in his body and clothes The uncanny instinct
of a dog had led him to the truth when even Winnies wife had been
deceived

This was a new twist in the maze I couldnt imagine the Master of
the RatRace watching with scientific detachment to see whether Frank
Jacklin would make it or would be disqualified in the first round Of
one thing I was certain unless I could establish some kind of personal
understanding with Ponto suspicion would gather around me For the
moment Germaine did not doubt that I was her husband my conduct had
puzzled her but she had lived with Winnie so long that it was probable
that she no longer specifically noticed him Virginia Rutherford would
be more dangerousshe was a woman scorned and she had been tricked
out of an intrigue She had every motive for digging out or even for
inventing the truth but I had given myself a good excuse to keep her
at arms length She couldnt force her way into my clubs I would
tell my office staff to keep her away from me and she couldnt be so
illbred as to thrust herself into my home If I could appease Ponto
and avoid Virginia I had a fair chance of getting away with it

Beg pardon sir It was Myrtle

Yes Mary

Mrs Rutherford is back sir She wants to see you

Tell her I am not at home I replied in a clear carrying tone And
that I never will be at home to her

Oh yes you will It was the redhead She was wearing a long mink
coat and carrying a short automatic pistol Like it or not Winnie
we are going to have a talknow She turned to the startled maid
And dont you try phoning the police Myrtle she added or the
first thing you will hear is this pistol going pop at Mr Winfred
Tompkins of New York City and Bedford Hills

Thats all right Mary I added Dont call the police Tell
Mrs Tompkins that Im busy Mrs Rutherford and I wish to have a
conversation
