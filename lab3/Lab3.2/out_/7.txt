As the door to the room slammed convulsively behind Myrtle Mrs
Rutherford relaxed laid the automatic on the sofa between us and
flung back her mink coat She was an appetizing little number if you
like em redhaired welldeveloped and mad through and through

Instinctively I started to reach for the gun but was checked by her
laugh

Take it by all means she said Its not loaded I only needed it
for the maid Tell me Winnie have you got her on your string too
The maid made or undone as they used to say

Virginia I said firmly I told you earlier this morning that we
were through Theres nothing more to be said about it Its finished
done kaput Alls well that ends

She laughed again and looked at me closely In spite of myself I
began pulling nervously at the lobe of my left ear a habit of mine
when confused which has always irritated my Dorothy

There Virginia said finally thats it

Her voice had a note of finality with a touch of total triumph that I
found disturbing

Well have you anything to say I asked

Have you anything to say

Ive already said it Virginia Nice as you are and beautiful as you
are were washed up It wont work and we both know it So why not
shake hands and quit friends

She took my proffered hand in hers but instead of shaking it examined
it carefully

Very clever she murmured Youve even got that little mole at the
base of your thumb

Of course I have Its been there since birth

Very very clever Winnie she continued but it wont do my
Winnie because you see you arent my Winnie at all Youre a total
stranger

Ive changed I admitted Im trying to be halfway decent

Whoever wanted Winnie to be halfway decent she mused Nobody
He was much pleasanter as he wasa rich friendly boob As for you
whoever you are Im on to your game You arent Winfred Tompkins and
you know it

I put some heavy sarcasm into my reply How did you ever guess Mrs
Rutherford

She laughed airily helped herself to a cigarette and leaned forward
while I lighted it so that I could not help seeing deep into the
straining V of her blouse

Lots of things In the first place you call me Virginia when were
alone instead of Bozo as you always used to do

I stopped calling you Bozo when I made up my mind I began

Nuts to you Buddy she rejoined Then you kept pulling at your ear
as though you were milking a cow while I was needling you Winnie
never did that When he was in a spot he always reached in his pocket
and jingled his change or as a desperate measure twiddled his keys

Dont judge my habits by my hangovers I insisted Im not feeling
well and Ive had a sort of psychic shock

Winnie never said psychic in his life poor lamb she observed He
didnt know what it meant No I dont know what your game is but Im
on to you and were going to be real buddies from now on or

Or what

The police she observed quietly take a dim view of murder in this
state Now Im willing to be broadminded Winnie was a louse who had
it coming to him I guess I was playing him for a quick divorce and
marriage Three million dollars is a lot of money even in these days
and it would have been nice to have been married to it But its even
nicer this way I guess

The decanter was within reach I poured myself another drink Have
some I asked

And why not Whats yours is mine and we both need it

Why did you say it was nicer this way Mrs Rutherford I inquired

Virginia to you Winnie Its because now I dont have to marry you
and I still have a pipeline to the Tompkins millions

So you are going in for blackmail I observed Suppose I
threatened to divorce Jimmie and marry you After all I still could

A girl has her pride she murmured Not that Id mind having fun
with you Winnieas I think Id better call you But a wife cant give
testimony against her husband and I think Id rather like to be able to
give testimony if needed Besides a husband has too many opportunities
to help the undertaker There are accidents in bathtubs and garages
medicines get mixed up in the bathroom cabinet and there is always the
oldfashioned hatchet No since youve managed to get rid of the other
Winnie somehow I think Ill keep a safe distance and my silence as
long as you make it worth my while

Suppose I wont play I suggested

Then Ill go to the police or the FBItheyre supposed to catch
kidnappers arent theyand tell them what I know

I stood up This would be easier than I had expected

Okay Virginia I said go right ahead Theres the telephone You
can use it to call the Secret Service for all I care See what luck you
have with your story when my wife is here to testify that Im Winnie
Tompkins

Her face paled and her eyes narrowed angrily Jimmie too she asked
Then youre both in it

Were both in what

The door opened and Germaine Tompkins stood in the entrance

Virginia Rutherford looked trapped and she instinctively pulled her
mink back over her shoulders

Nothing Jimmie she said at last I was foolish enough to hope that
if I came back and had a talk alone with Winnie we could pick up
where we left off Hes been acting so strangely that he doesnt seem
like himself at all And so are you Thats what I meant by saying that
you were both in it

Virginia my wife said firmly my husband told you to stay out of
this houseand its my home tooand now I find you here Please go
or Ill call the police

The two women exchanged appraising glances which suggested that they
were both thoroughly enjoying the touch of melodrama that had come into
their wellfed lives

No its my fault for letting her in I said She sent in word by
Mary

You mean Myrtle

that she would like to see me I agreed to do so so you cant blame
her We talked things over and decided that its all offa few moments
of madness but thats all and not worth wrecking two marriages for
Isnt that so Mrs Rutherford

Virginia shook her head No Winnie it is not so Jimmie I came here
with that gun It wasnt loaded but the next time it will be I made
Myrtle or whatever her name is show me in and I told her I would shoot
Winnie if she gave the alarm Then I told him what I know about him

And what is that my wife asked

That he is not Winnie at all Virginia declared That he is an
imposter that he and perhaps you had done away with poor old Winnie I
told him that I wouldnt tell his secret if he paid me to keep silent
And he told me to call the police

My wife went over to her and took her hand Poor darling Virginia
she murmured why dont you go away and have a good rest Youve got
yourself all worked up for a nervous breakdown Of course its Winnie
Im married to him and I ought to know my own husband shouldnt I
Youve simply got run down and all with rationing and warwork Why
dont you let Jerry send you for a few weeks to the Hartford Sanctuary
for psychoanalysis and a good rest

Virginia dashed my wifes hand away In other words you think Im
crazy she snapped

No but I do think youre hysterical This is Winnie Im Jimmie
and youre Virginia Rutherford Weve all been letting ourselves get
overemotional and this war is a strain on everybody Dont worry
Jerry can fix it for you quite easily and Iwe both will be glad
to help pay for it if youre worried about the money After all
Germaine added wryly the whole thing is pretty much of a family
affair isnt it Lets keep it that way

Mrs Rutherford reached over and grabbed the gun from the sofa

All right Germaine Tompkins murderess she grated If thats the
way youre going to play it Ill play too Dont worry about my mind
Start thinking about the electric chair Remember in this state they
execute women who kill their husbands

Jimmie waited until the door closed behind the doctors wife Then she
turned to me with a curious expression of weariness

Poor man she remarked You have got yourself into a bad mess
havent you

I nodded

It didnt seem like one while I was getting into it I said Its
only now when Im trying to get things straightened out that it seems
so awful

Lets see she continued How many women is it youve been trying to
keep away from each other Theres myself of course but wives dont
count any more do they And theres Virginia Rutherford and Myrtle
and there was that blonde actress we met at Marthas Vineyard last
summer and is it one or two girls at the office

Here was where I could object with complete sincerity I swear that
Ive not been fooling with any of the office girls I said

I know Jimmie agreed wisely You always used to tell me that it was
considered bad for business to play with the help but after I saw the
way you went for Myrtle I decided that there were exceptions to every
rule

Nobody in the office I repeated I swear it

Then perhaps it was the office next door Maybe you brokers have
an exchange system for taking on each others stenographerscharge
it to business expenses for getting information about each others
dealingsbut I know Ive heard the name Briggs mentioned somehow in
your connection

The name means absolutely nothing to me I insisted If it will make
you any happier Ill admit to a hundred women but Im through with all
that sexstuff From now on Im going to be a onewoman man

Germaine faced me with an air of resolution Would you mind giving me
a drink of brandy she asked Ive something to say to you and Im
afraid you wont like it

I went to the portable bar and poured her a pony of Courvoisier

Here you are Down the hatch And now what is it you want to tell me

Believe me Winnie she said its not easy for me But Id better
say it anyhow I cant keep on suppressing it Who are you

Whats that

Who are you she repeated You look like my husband but you dont
talk like him His clothes fit you but Virginia Rutherford is quite
rightyou arent Winnie Tompkins

How did you guess

Dont think Ill give you away she continued I wont because
you must have had a terribly important reason for doing whatever you
have done You seem to be in deep trouble of some kind IId like
to help you if I can Dont think Im hard on my husband Its been
years since weoh you know I married him for his money and I still
dont know why he married me Yes I do but Ive never liked to admit
it Hed made a lot of money in the market and had built this house
He needed a wife the way he needed an automobile a portable bar a
Capehart a thoroughbred Great Dane and a membership in the Pond Club
I was available at a price which he metbut thats all there is to
our story

Poor Jimmie I sympathized Were both lost I guess No Im not
Winnie but I dont know who else I could possibly be You see less
than twentyfour hours ago I was a lieutenantcommander on a light
carrier in the North Pacific and

Germaine slowly withdrew her hand from mine

Oh she exclaimed softly Oh Winnie Poor old idiot Ill take care
of you and see that you get over this Wait Ill call the doctor right
away The Hartford Sanctuarys a very nice place and I can come over
every week to

I shook my head Youll do nothing of the kind my dear I ordered
No doctor can help me on this one Besides I added how do you know
that I wasnt batty before and have just come to my senses

Her eyes were frightened All right dear she agreed I like you
better this way anyhow
