Say old man what happened to your hand Graham Wasson plump dark
and fortyish but very cleancut and with a Dewey dab on his upper
lip was my questioner He sat across the glasstopped desk in my Wall
Street Office while Arthurjean Briggs typed demurely in the adjoining
office

Changing razorblades I confessed The damn thing slipped and
before I knew it I made a grab for it Lucky it didnt go deep Hence
the surgical gauze and the lousy signature Do you think you can get my
check cleared through the bank or should I write Winnie X Tompkins
his mark

Wasson chuckled like a wellfed broker Well get enough witnesses to
your John Hancock to make it legal he promised Now what youve got
to do is to ease old lady Fynch into the trustees delight and take a
gander at her former investments Ive brought the list with me As you
know she insisted that you okay the deal

I glanced at the typed list This stuff looks pretty good to me
Graham I said Detroit Edisons safe as the Washington Monument
ATT is solid and GE ought to do all right with this new
electronic stuff

Dr Rutherford was pacing with surgical precision up and down my den
He looked slightly more selfpossessed than the day before and seemed
to be in excellent physical condition I guessed at the contour beneath
my wadded black silk dressing gown and reconsidered my original
plan to throw him bodily out of the house for having come without my
invitation

And how My partner agreed Boy what a windfall Stuff like that is
scarcer than hens teeth on the open market With close to a million
bucks to turn over we ought to do pretty well on this Heres what
were buying for her

Wasson passed me a slip of paper The trustees delight he said
GBonds You buy em we should worry No money back for ten years
Morgenthaus dreamchild

The slip was attached to a printed Treasury form See here I
pointed out These damn bonds depreciate 22 a year for the first
five years and then start climbing up the ladder again and theyre
nontransferable

Thats it Winnie The trustees delight Wasson agreed They pay
212 a year if you hold them but if you try to sell them within
five years the discount means you only get about 03 on your money
Once a trustee has put you aboard this rollercoaster he cant
conscientiously advise you to get out

Who dreamed up that swindle

Oh a couple of dollarayear bankers we sent down to help the
Treasury win the war Its a natural Its patriotic to invest in
warbonds The yields conservative as hell and you get it all back if
you wait long enough

But what if the old girl dies within the next five years Wont the
estate be liquidated How will the heirs feel when they have to take a
loss of 60000

Thats their worry Winnie Wasson pointed out All we have to do is
sign the papers and la Fynch gets about 25000 a year for the rest of
her life

Instead of the 40000 a year shes getting out of her present
investments now

Sure Winnie Were not in business for our health Industrials are
risky and Miss Fynch is awful set on beating Hitler We take over her
present portfolio and take our chances on the market If values shift
were in a position to unloadbut fast She isnt She only gets to
town twice a year once between Bar Harbor and Long Island and then
next time from Palm Beach to Long Island Come on Winnie stick your
fist on these papers and Ill handle the transfers

I shook my head Id like to think this over I said If I was an
old woman and expected only five or ten more years of life Id be
hanged if Id tie myself down to these financial mustardplasters It
sounds okay to be patriotic but I think Id stick to the greater risks
and higher yields and get a run for my money Tell you what Graham
you phone and tell her Id like to have a talk with her before she
makes up her mind

Wasson shoved back his chair and faced me bristling Ill be damned
if I will This is a natural and handled right is worth 100000 to
the firm You talked her into it and now if youre getting cold feet
you can talk her out of it All I know is that youve gone nuts

We arent so hard up that we have to swindle old ladies

Swindle my eye Whats wrong about 25000 a year guaranteed by your
Uncle Sam

Less income tax I reminded him

Oh surethat

Well its about 15000 a year less than shes getting now If she
sold out and invested in an annuity she could get about 70000 a year
taxfree No I dont want to rush her into this

Then youve forgotten how we made our pile in the first place my
partner growled Phil Cone and I will have to talk this over This is
a fine time to go soft on us

I grinned at him Go on talk it over If you want out youre
welcome Id rather like you to stick around as Im on to something
really big and I dont want the Street to say we fleeced our clients

I resent that Winnie Wasson snapped

What else would you call it Reinvesting

Listen he exploded You built up this business You invented the
methods Im damned if I let you call me a swindler for following your
lead And he stormed out slamming the door A moment later he stuck
his head in again Forget it Winnie If youre working on a big
operation count me in

I studied the list of the Fynch investments again and the more I saw
it the more I wondered how anybody but a fool would fall for the
proposition of putting money in the government bonds for ten years
when you could clean up outside government

There was a tap on the edge of my desk I looked up to see Arthurjean
Mr Harcourt is back to see you she said Ill get set with the
stenotype And dont worry about that Fynch dame Ill give you a
fillin later She knows what shes doing

Fine I told her Now you show Mr Harcourt in and make with the
stenotype Did you finish copying what we said yesterday

Her mouth dropped open and her sweater quivered eloquently Omigawd
baby I clean forgot

Mr Harcourt seemed much more vital and selfpossessed than on the
previous afternoonperhaps because he had obviously had a sleep a
shower and a hearty breakfast presumably prefaced by ten minutes of
vigorous pushups and toetouching in bathroom calisthenics At any
rate he looked fit

Morning Harcourt I said casually Sorry to tell you that Miss
Briggs was home with a bad headache last night and wasnt able to make
that copy of our talk yesterday

GMen on duty are not supposed to smile without written permission from
their immediate superior but Harcourt must have had an extra helping of
Wheaties for breakfast Call yourself a headache Mr Tompkins he
asked Thats who our man reported Miss Briggs had last night at 157
East 51st Street third floor front Can I get her some aspirin

There are no secrets from the Gestapo I observed and I have no
comment to offer except to say next time come on up and have a drink
with us instead of doing the GMan in a cold and drafty doorway across
the street

The Special Agent gave an entirely unofficial wink at Arthurjean
Oh hell he remarked Whats the use of all this coy stuff The
Bureau isnt interested in your private life What I wanted to say Mr
Tompkins is that I reported our talk to my chief and he teletyped my
report down to Washington Were not going to fool around with Church
Street on this one The Directors going to take it up direct with
Admiral Ballister at the Navy Department For my part I told him I
thought it was all a pipedream but like I said the FBI doesnt
believe in dreams that come true

Arthurjean crossed the room and stood behind him pressing a little
unregenerately against the back of his chair until Harcourt remarked
conversationally to U S Grant in the engraving Im a married man
baby with a wife and kids in Brooklyn

My secretary smiled and gave him a smart tap on the top of his head
Youre a good boy junior she told him and Im all for you But
dont you go making trouble for this dumb boss of mine or Ill call on
your wife personal and Tell All

Harcourt murmured to the engraving that unconditional surrender was
his name too but that Tompkins was making so much trouble for
himself that he was damned if he could see how the FBI could make it
any worse In any case he added more directly he would keep in touch
with me and let me know whether I was wanted up at the Federal Court
House

See here Harcourt I replied One good turn doesnt make a spring
This is the screwiest case youve ever been on If you can drop in and
visit Miss Briggs and myself on Saturday after lunch at our place Ill
give you a fillin that will rock the FBI from its gats to its
toupees

Thats mighty white of youand Miss Briggs the Special Agent
allowed If the chief lets me Ill meet you up there say about 230

Swell I said And which do you preferScotch or rye

I dont drink on duty he told me but I find Bourbon helps fight
off colds this early spring weather

After his departure I locked myself in the office and with
Arthurjeans help brought myself up to date on Winnies business
operations Tompkins Wasson  Cone were not as I had believed a
hightoned bucketshop The proposed Fynch swindle was only the result
of a dopey old maid who practically insisted on helping beat the Axis
by turning her money into Government bonds There was plenty of honest
graft and many a solid perquisite in straight commission work and
supervision of estates The firm was not of course very scrupulous
but it always gave value for its transactions It was in fact a
pretty slick setup

There was a buzz on my interoffice telephone and the receptionist
announced Mr Axel Roscommon to see you Mr Tompkins

Oh ask him to see one of the other partners will you

I told him that you were too busy but he said he must see you and
would wait

He too I asked Okay Send him in Do you know an Axel Roscommon
Arthurjean

Uhuh She shook her head The names sorta familiar Something in
oil before Pearl Harbor I can find out if youll wait a bit

Never mind I told her Ill see him You stay in the next room and
keep the door ajar so you can take a record

She laughed I can do better than that boss Ill switch down the
interoffice phones and keep the door shut That way Ill hear every
word you say Its like a dictaphone

Mr Roscommon was an extremely well set up man in the middle fifties
about sixfeet two lean with iron grey hair a grey moustache
steelblue eyes and a beartrap grip He looked prosperous but not
worried by it He spoke with a faint Irish lilt in his voice but his
manner was most direct and unHibernian

Mr Tompkins he remarked You must excuse the lack of formality
but you will understand when I tell you that I am chief of the German
intelligence organization in the United States Now dont think Im
crazy or indiscreet The only reason I have come to you is because my
agents in the FBI tell me that you are involved in the sinking of
USS Alaska off the Aleutians Thorium bombs wasnt it Chalmis was
a pretty smart chap and I warned our people that he was getting hot
Now I dont ask you why in Wotans name the Fuehrer thinks it makes
sense to have two intelligence services in this country Probably
Berlin didnt like my last reports No dont get excited Ive engaged
in no subversive activities Im an Irish Free State citizen and if you
go to Washington youll find that they know all about me Hitler may
want the old Goetterdaemmerung spirit in our outfit but I cant see the
point of too much zeal

I offered him a cigarette What do you want to see me about Mr
Roscommon I asked For all you know there may be dictaphones planted
all over the place My last visitor today was actually a special agent
of the FBI

Roscommon lighted his cigarette with a flick of a gold Dunhill lighter
That would be HarcourtA J Harcourtwouldnt it A fine chap and
a conscientious agent Id heard hed been assigned to your case
Youll find him completely reliable As you know in time of war there
has to be some practical way of maintaining direct confidential
communication between the enemies Switzerland Bah All milk
chocolate profiteering and eyewash I wouldnt trust a Swiss as far as
I could throw the SubTreasury Building Im acting here for Berlin and
you have at least three men in Berlin to keep in touch with the German
Government over there Thats the only practical way modern wars can be
fought eh As Edith Cavell said last time Patriotism is not enough
The fact is that even in war two great countries like Germany and
America must and do maintain direct contact

I pushed the button for Arthurjean Miss Briggs I asked have we
any brandy in the office

Deadpan and nonchalant she crossed the room to a small safe
disguised as a Victorian lowboy twiddled the dials and revealed a
neat little Frigidaire She prepared two brandies and soda handed
them to us and returned to her office

Prosit said I

Heil Roosevelt Roscommon answered

But what did you want to see me about I inquired You may be all
right but Im already under investigation by the FBI

Nonsense old boy nonsense he reassured me If they get
troublesome let me knowIm in the phone book and my girl will always
know where to reach me day or nightand Ill tell Washington to stop
proceedings No Tompkins what I wanted to tell you was thatwhen
you report back to your superior and Ill lay tentoone hes that
ass Ribbentropjust tell him that the wars lost Our game now is
to salvage resources for the next war which will be against Russia
unless I miss my guess Weve got to use these last few weeks and
days to rush funds patents papers brains and organization out of
the Reich Send them to Sweden to Switzerland to Italy Fly them to
Spain slip them in Uboats to Buenos Aires or Dublin Tell Ribbentrop
that New York understands our problem and will play the game right
across the board but there must be no shillyshallying no nonsense
about last stands If Hitler wants a Siegfried finish let him have
it but from now on our job is to save Germany as an asset for her
Western Allies and as a people whom the world will need to fight the
Soviets Tell him that will you old man Thanks most awfully

Roscommon finished his drink with an expert swirl of the glass smiled
shook hands and left the room as abruptly as he had arrived in it I
picked up the outside phone

Get me FBI Headquarters I said I wish to speak to Mr A J
Harcourt Thanks Ill wait
