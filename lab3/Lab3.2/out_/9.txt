And so Arthurjean I concluded my guess is that for some crazy
reason its up to me to take up where Winnie left off and try to do a
good job with the hand hes dealt himself

She remained silent hunched on the floor beside me with her maroon
pyjamas straining visibly and a pile of cigarette butts in the
ashtray at her side

Give me a break I pleaded When I tried to tell my wifeWinnies
wifeMrs Tompkins that isall she could think of was to send me off
to a plushlined boobyhatch until I was sane again The othersat
least Virginia Rutherfordare beginning to suspect that something is
wrong and that damned dog knows it So be original and pretend that I
might be telling the truth

She didnt answer Instead she stood up stretched strolled over to
the kitchenette and mixed us both two good stiff drinks

Mud in your eye she said

Glad to see you on board

I dont see why not she observed conversationally I dont pretend
to be smart and I know that the other girls in the office think Im
nothing but a tramp because I dont pretend I dont like men but Im
damned if I think that Winnie who is one of Gods sweetest dumbbells
could have dreamed up anything as screwy as this

As I remember him he wasnt any too bright I said

Skip it He wasnt dumb in business He picked up a couple of million
bucks and gave them a good home in his safedeposit box He wasnt so
hot on music and books and artexcept for his damned ducksbut he was
a lot of fun He liked a good time and he liked a girl to have a good
time He should have been born in one of those Latin countries where
the women do all the work and the men play guitars drink and make
love

I drew a deep breath I had won my first convert I knew what Paul
of Tarsus felt when he met up with Timothy I thought of Mahomet and
Fatima Karl Marx and Bakunin Hitler and Hess Crazy though the whole
world would consider me here was one human being who could listen to
my story without phoning for an ambulance

Tell me about this Frank Jacklin Arthurjean remarked I dont get
all the angles about him and this Dorothy Seems to me youWinnie
that istold me he was the guy shed had a sort of crush on at school
Winnie was still sort of sore about it twenty years later

Its hard for me to be fair I admitted Jacklin was a big shot at
school and may have had a swelled head Winnie wasnt so hot thennice
but with too much money Jacklins people were poor by comparison that
is He got through Yale slid out into the newspaper game held his
job married a girl had a bustup with his wife and joined the Navy as
a reserve officer after she walked out on him The Navy assigned him to
PRO work and sent him to the Pacific

He sounds like a heel she observed leaving his wife like that
Tell me more about her Is she pretty

I thought a long time I dont quite know I said finally I never
knew She was necessary to me long after I was necessary to her She
had a mole on her left hip and a gruff way of talking when she was
really fond of me I guess she got tired of living in Hartford and took
it out on me

Any kids

I shook my head vigorously Cost too much on a newspaper salary She
said she didnt want any until we could afford them I was fool enough
to believe her Then when we could afford them she didnt want them
Cant say I blame her

Did she make you happy

Of course not Who wants to be happy She made me miserable but
it was exciting to be around her I never knew what Id find when
I got homea knockdown dragout fight over nothing at all or
heartsandflowers equally over nothing

Arthurjean yawned That parts convincing she agreed Ill play
this one straight Youre Frank Jacklin and Winnie Tompkins rolled
into one The point is where do we go from here Lets see you sign
Jacklins name

I pulled out Winnies gold lifetime fountain pen and wrote Frank E
Jacklin over and over again on the back of an envelope She studied it
carefully

Thats no phony she agreed and its nothing like Winnies
handwriting Think I could get a check cashed on it

Lets try I suggested Tomorrow when I get to the office Ill
predate a check on the Riggs Bank at Washington You mail it in for
collection and well see if it clears

She shook her head No dice If I tried that first thing we know wed
have the ABA dicks after you for forgery Can you think of anything
else

Not unless you go to Washington and see Dorothy in OSS and ask her
to verify my handwriting Or wait You can go and talk to her and
notice whether she wriggles her nose to keep her spectacles up You
can find out whether shes still nuts about Prokofiev You can ask if
she still thinks that Ernest Hemingway is a worse writer than Charles
Dickens and whether she still uses Chanels Gardenia perfume

Thats enough she interrupted But howm I going to get to
Washington and do all these things

Next week I said you and I can fly down on a business
tripwarcontracts cutbacks something officialand while Im being
whipsawed by the deskheroes you can check on Dorothy See if Im not
right

She nodded Thats one way What can we cook up The office is tied up
in estate work and that leaves no chance for Uncle Sam You get what he
leaves the heirs and they tell me that the inheritance tax is here to
stay

I considered the problem Tell you what Arthurjean I replied Ive
been thinking this over The wars going to end this summer What I saw
on the Alaska means that nobody can hold out against us The Germans
are on their last legs but most of the wise guys are saying that
it will take from eighteen months to two years to clean up Japana
million casualties billions of dollars This thorium bomb will do
the trick and the war will be over by Labor Day Theres a chance for
Winnie Tompkins to make another two or three millions

She laughed sardonically How

Theres uranium stocks I suggested

All sewed up by the insiders Last year youor Winniegot a query on
uranium and found that there wasnt any to be had

Theres wheat and sugar I argued The worlds going to be hungry
Theres a famine coming sure as hell Buy futures and well be set

Sure she agreed if you want to buy Black and can get funds into
Cuba or the Argentine But there are interallied pools operating in
sugar and wheat and you cant break into the game without connections
at Washington

How about peacebabies I demanded We can sell our war bonds and
invest in something solid for postwar reconstruction Say General
Motors or US Steel

Arthurjean crossed the room and rumpled my head affectionately Baby
she observed its damn lucky for you and Winnies dough I know my way
around the Street Lay off heavy industrials until the labor business
gets straightened out Its all set for a big strikewave when the
shooting stops and a lot of investors are going to be burned You can
sell short of course but youll have to wait for that If you must go
in for gambling try the racetrack or the slotmachines Uncle Sam has
it fixed so that the only way you can make money out of the peace is
to be a Swiss or a Swede

But that doesnt make sense I objected In any place and at any
time advance knowledge on what is going to happen is worth a fortune
How about selling some of the war industries short

She shook her head You wait till youve been to Washington Some of
the smart guys down there may know the answers Perhaps it will be
realestate if they can only get rid of rentcontrol Probably it will
be surplus warstocks but thats going to be a political racket Anyhow
the taxcollector will be waiting for you so why worry

Speaking of cashing checks I reminded her how in hell am I going
to get some dough How does Winnie sign himself at the City Farmers
anyhow

She laughed He has three or four separate accounts The one he uses
for purely personal hellraising is just signed W S Tompkins Lets
see you try to write that Remember he loops all his letters and draws
a little circle instead of a dot over the i

I tried that a few times until she shook her head

There isnt a bankclerk in New York who wouldnt stop a check with
that on it Lets see he signed his name to something around here See
if you cant copy it

She fumbled under a pile of magazines and finally came up with a copy
of The Story of Philosophy by Will Durant

Winnie thought this would be good for me she explained Here
it is For Miss Arthurjean Briggs with the compliments of W S
Tompkins He was like thatsort of formalit gave him a kick He
bought that for me secondhand after wed been drinking Atlantic City
dry at an investment bankers convention Try it

I tried the signature again but the effort was even worse than my
freehand efforts This time it looked like what it wasa clumsy
forgery

Hell I exclaimed Ive simply got to do better than that How about
my tracing it

Youd be surprised she told me how easy it is to spot a signature
thats been traced Its something about the flow of the ink and the
angle of the pen No two signatures are exactly alike and thats why a
tracing gives itself away They got machines which spot it

Well howm I going to get some dough I demanded I cant draw on
Jacklins Washington accountand the chances are there isnt much
there anyhow And if I try to draw on Tompkins account Ill find
myself in the hoosegow

She got up and mixed us another pair of drinks I got it she
announced It wont be too nice for you but its better than starving

You mean youll lend me some

Hell baby I got no moneytwentyfive or thirty in the account and a
few hundreds in warbonds No this is better Just hold out your hand
and shut your eyes

It sounded like jewels I leaned back in the chair closed my eyes and
extended my right hand in front of me palm upward I heard her pad
into the bathroom When she came back her voice sounded strained as
she whispered This is it baby Keep those eyes shut

There was a smooth tingling sensation across the tips of my fingers
then my right hand was suddenly warm and wet I opened my eyes to see
Arthurjean holding a stained safetyrazor blade in her hand and staring
at me whitefaced as the blood trickled from my fingertips

Winnie she faltered and slumped down in the divan

I hastily grabbed the handkerchief from my breastpocket and wrapped it
around my throbbing fingers

Ouch Damn you I exclaimed

Im sorry baby she whispered I didnt want to hurt you It seemed
the only way

You damned fool I almost shouted at her Do you realize you flopped
with that blade in your hand and might have cut an artery

No did I She scrambled up hastily and looked around Gee I feel
lousy Does it hurt much

Not yet Whats the big idea

Now you sound like Winnie she replied He never got ideas easy
Listen you big slob if youve cut your fingers you got to have a
bandage and if you got a bandage on your right hand your signatures
going to be screwy All you need do is fumble it and I or one of the
girls will witness it and the bank will clear it and youll get the
dough

I thought that one over Youve got something in your head besides
those big blue eyes I admitted Now if you only have some iodine and
bandages well see if I can stave off lockjaw

She giggled Lockjaws the last thing youll get she said There
ought to be something in the medicine cabinet Gee she added I
suppose Ill have to get you undressed and dress you in the morning
just like a baby Aint that something

How about some food I demanded You said something about a steak
back at the office and all youve given me is Scotch and razorblades
You get on with your cooking and let me try to fix my hand

I went into the bathroom located some mercurochrome and a box of band
aids Once the flow of blood had slacked I managed to incapacitate
myself sufficiently for the purpose of forging Winnie Tompkins
signature

Say Winnie Arthurjean suddenly appeared at the bathroom door with
an aroma of steak behind her Ive just figured out something If you
arent Winnie but a ringer from the Aleutians its not decent for you
to see me in my pyjamas Were strangers

Oh keep em on till after dinner I said I wont stand on
ceremony Im hungry

She laughed You sure can make like Winnie she admired Jesus the
steaks burning
